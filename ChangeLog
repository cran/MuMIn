MuMIn package changelog:

Version: 0.12.2 (2009-06-14)
fixed: alpha in model.avg was not passed to par.avg

Version: 0.12.1 (2009-04-20)
fixed: method="NA" in model.avg, par.avg now accepts NA's in 'weight'

Version: 0.12.0 (2009-03-24)
Change in version number only. Had to make this jump in numbering, as there was a typo in DESCRIPTION file of an early version, 
(0.11.2 instead of 0.1.0), and since then R-forge mechanism ignored actual newer versions, as they had lower number.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-22)
Modified: dredge: added "fixed" and "m.max" arguments.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root of variance). 
	Thanks to Mick Wu.
Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations, so now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

Version 0.1.0
dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, its name changed to MuMIn - MUltiModelINference.
