MuMIn package changelog:

Version: 0.13.8 (2010-08-03)
QAIC: examples expanded

Version: 0.13.7 (2010-08-02)
dredge: prints errors generated by models as warnings (previously these were skipped silently)

Version: 0.13.6 (2010-08-01)
print.model.selection: improved column abbreviation

Version: 0.13.5 (2010-07-31)
dredge: fixed a bug causing interaction coefficients to be stripped from
model.selection table, new function 'fixCoefNames' (not exported)handles proper
ordering of interaction components in coefficient names

Version: 0.13.4 (2010-07-21)
'beta.weights' now uses 'tTable' (support for more model types), 'dredge' with
beta=TRUE tries out if it can get beta.weights working.
Manual: added gls and rlm to the list of supported models

Version: 0.13.3 (2010-07-15)
Bug fixed in print.averaging

Version: 0.13.2 (2010-07-14)
Attributes for custom rank function in "dredge" and "model.avg" are now
evaluated model-wise, if provided as expressions

Version: 0.13.0-1 (2010-07-12)
Fixed compatibility issues with models of class "lme" and "sarlm".
"model.avg" does now some checking whether all models were fitted to the same
data and have the same response.

Version: 0.12.13 (2010-07-09)
'recalc.weights' argument added to "subset.model.selection".
Small bug fixed in dredge.

Version: 0.12.12 (2010-07-08)
New in "dredge": Subsetting models a priori according to a formula

Version: 0.12.11 (2010-07-07)
Subset/extract methods for 'model.selection' object

Version: 0.12.10 (2010-07-05)
Fixed "predict.averaging" for missing 'newdata' handling; Table returned by
"dredge" now has factors for terms with more than one level (they were
previously shown as '1')

Version: 0.12.9 (2010-07-03)
Finally fixed problems with variable exporting and hidden methods

Version: 0.12.7-8 (2010-07-02)
Small changes in namespace and documentation

Version: 0.12.6 (2010-06-26)
Tidying up the code, small changes.

Version: 0.12.4 (2010-06-21)
added: "predict.averaging" and "coef.averaging", 'averaging' object contains
additional elements, so that several default methods work with it.

Version: 0.12.2 (2009-06-14)
fixed: 'alpha' in "model.avg" was not passed to "par.avg"

Version: 0.12.1 (2009-04-20)
fixed: method="NA" in model.avg, par.avg now accepts NA's in 'weight'

Version: 0.12.0 (2009-03-24)
Change in version number only. Had to make this jump in numbering, as there was
a typo in DESCRIPTION file of an early version, (0.11.2 instead of 0.1.0), and
since then R-forge mechanism seemed to ignore actual newer versions, as they had
lower number.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-22)
Modified: dredge: added "fixed" and "m.max" arguments.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root
of variance). Thanks to Mick Wu.
Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations, so
now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

Version 0.1.0
dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, its name changed
to MuMIn - MUltiModelINference.
