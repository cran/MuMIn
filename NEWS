MuMIn package news:

Version: 1.15.6 (2015-12-21)
(fixed) get.models, dredge, subset.model.selection: enclosure for the subset 
    expression evaluation is now `parent.frame()` rather than `.GlobalEnv` as it
    was before (incentive from Philipp Maier).
(fixed) coeffs.survreg, coefTable.survreg: log(scale) added to coefficients, when
    it is estimated (suggested by Nicolas Rode)

Version: 1.15.5 (2015-11-25)
(fixed) [p]dredge: error with model with offsets in formula when 'subset' 
    expression was given (reported by Adam Cummings)
(fixed) [p]dredge: in some cases the generated combinations did not obey the 
    subset matrix (reported by Ben Augustine)
(fixed) model.selection column assignment "[<-" was broken when (spotted by
    a certain abmiller8 on Stackoverflow)
model.avg: warns when averaged 'gam' models have smooths with different
    dimension for the same variable.

Version: 1.15.4 (2015-10-16)
(fixed) rbind, merge methods for "model.selection": wrong order of names of 
    columns and rows (spotted by Ben Augustine)

Version: 1.15.3 (2015-09-06)
(fixed) Weights: bug that caused that NaN's were returned (reported by Carles 
    Alcaraz)

Version: 1.15.2 (2015-07-07)
(added) summary.coefTable: tries to calculate p-values for coefficients, nicer 
    printing using printCoefmat

Version: 1.15.1 (2015-07-02)
added imports from all the default packages added to NAMESPACE in order to 
    satisfy CRAN's new stricter RCheck.

Version: 1.50.0 (2015-07-01)
(added) arm.glm: implements model averaging with weights calculated via ARM 
    ("adaptive regression by mixing") algorithm.
"averaging" object: the elements "coef.shrinkage" and "coefTable" are
    replaced by matrix named "coefficients". The "Pval-tables" are accessed via 
    summary(averaging)'s elements "coefmat.full" and "coefmat.subset". Objects 
    created with previous versions will be automatically converted if needed.
[p]dredge: argument 'm.lim' replaces 'm.min' and 'm.max' (which are still 
    present, but deprecated).
"model.selection" object: changing or removing essential columns (i.e. 
    everything except 'varying' and 'extra') converts the object to a plain 
    "data.frame" and drops all additional attributes. 
(added) rbind.model.selection: combine multiple "model.selection" objects.
(added) 'xtable' methods for "averaging" and "model.selection" objects.
(fixed) updateable: does not cause infinite recursion when the resulting wrapper
    has the same name as the wrapped function.
(fixed) exprApply: now can deal with function expressions and 'expression's 
    longer than one.

Version: 1.14.1 (2015-06-12)
(fixed) [p]dredge no longer gives coefficient values as NA with [g]lmer 
    (reported by Aitor Cevidanes).
Some tidying-up of manual and data (response in 'Cement' and 'Beetle' moved to 
    first column so that formula(data) is correct).

Version: 1.14.0 (2015-06-03)
(added) partial.sd, std.coef: calculate partial std. deviation and standardize 
    model coefficients. 'beta.weights' is now deprecated in favour of 
    'std.coef'.
dredge, model.avg, model.sel: argument 'beta' is modified to allow for 
    standardizing with SD or partial SD.
coefTable, coeffs: method for class 'aodml' (package 'aod3') no longer return 
    'phi' coefficients. This is for consistency with results of 'vcov' and 
    'coef', as well as their counterparts for 'glimML' models.
Removed all methods for 'mer' objects (used in lme4 < 1.0.0)

Version: 1.13.10 (2015-06-01)
(fixed) compatibility with lme4-1.1.8, 'null.fit' now works properly with 'gamm' 
    objects.

Version: 1.13.9 (2015-05-28)
stdize: improved interpretation of the argument "scale".
new dataset "GPA" ("First-year college Grade Point Average" referred in Burnham 
    & Anderson (2002)).

Version: 1.13.8 (2015-05-22)
(added) QIC support for 'geem' models (request from Lee McDaniel).

Version: 1.13.7 (2015-05-14)
coefTable: method for 'averaging' objects gains new arguments "full" and 
    "adjust.se".
(fixed) getAllTerms: now correctly names coefficients of 'unmarked::gdistsamp' 
    models (reported by Nathan Hostetter)

Version: 1.13.6 (2015-05-01)
(fixed) model.avg, model.sel: now better distinguish model objects from lists of 
    objects.

Version: 1.13.5 (2015-04-15)
(fixed) r.squaredGLMM: method for 'lme' class with a multilevel grouping 
    structure (reported by Alex Gunderson)

Version: 1.13.4 (2015-02-24)
coefTable.coxph: added workaround for the case when variance-covariance matrix 
    is NA (as in results of 'intcox') (reported by Vanessa Boukili)

Version: 1.13.3 (2015-02-19)
get.models+subset.model.selection: unified 'subset' expression interpretation
dredge: no longer exceeds memory limit with very complex models, and its 
    efficiency has somewhat improved. With trace=2 a progress bar is displayed.
model.sel: has new attribute 'fit'.
"averaging" object now stores component models.
model.sel,subset,get.models: unified interpretation of the "subset" expression
(fixed) extracting random effects formula (affected 'r.squaredGLMM' for 'lmer', 
    reported by Yevgen Matusevych)
(fixed) makeArgs (and hence 'dredge'): formulas with no intercept are now 
    handled correctly in 'zeroinfl' models.

Version: 1.13.2 (2015-01-08)
(fixed) makeArgs (and hence 'dredge'): gave error if no random effects 
    was specified in 'glmmadmb' model (reported by Szymek Drobniak).

Version: 1.13.1 (2015-01-06)
(fixed) getAllTerms: now properly handles single formula in 'hurdle' and 
    'zeroinfl' models (package 'pscl').

Version: 1.13.0 (2015-01-03)
(added) get.response: utility to extract response variable.

Version: 1.12.4 (2014-12-26)
(added) stdizeFit: utility to modify model object or a call to modelling function 
    to use standardized data.

Version: 1.12.3 (2014-12-23)
(fixed) checkModels: workaround for the "dotted argument identity" issue (namely
    sometimes equal "..1"s are not identical).

Version: 1.12.2 (2014-12-19)
(fixed) [Q]AICc: previously they ignored REML argument for some model classes.
    The code has been rewritten so that most of the core calculation is done by
    a common internal function.

Version: 1.12.1 (2014-12-16)
minor corrections to the documentation

Version: 1.12.0 (2014-12-16)
(added) exprApply: new function to manipulate expressions (with example of use
    with 'dredge' to manipulate terms inside formula).
dredge, subset.model.selection: curly braces can be used to indicate complex 
    terms (e.g. {I(x)} or {s(x,k=2}) instead of backtick quotes. Spacing in 
    these expressions is irrelevant (as both whitespace and backticks seem to be 
    a problem for some users).

Version: 1.11.3 (2014-12-10)
(added) stdize: new function for standardizing data
(fixed) smarter sorting of interaction terms in coefficient names
print.model.selection: rank function call is added to the output

Version: 1.11.2 (2014-12-01)
(fixed) r.squaredGLMM: in "binomial" family models the residual variance is 
    used for additive dispersion (thanks to Paul Johnson). 
    There is still issue with 'lmer' with 'subset' argument, and 
    observation-level random term has to be specified manually.
(fixed) some formula-decomposition related functions (that sometimes caused 
    problems with 'r.squaredGLMM' for 'lmer', reported by Yevgen Matusevych)
dredge: warns about potentially misspecified arguments 
(added) predict method for 'gamm' class

Version: 1.11.1 (2014-11-19)
dredge: more efficient checking for marginality in model terms (~10x faster in 
    case of 4-way interaction). The argument 'marg.ex' is removed (exceptions 
    to marginality rule are inferred from the global model). 
getAllTerms: result has a new attribute 'deps' with a "term dependency matrix". 
nested: new function listing nested models (suggested by Giacomo Assandri).
updateable: added new argument 'eval.args'

Version: 1.10.8 (2014-11-14)
dredge, subset.model.selection: improved interpretation of 'subset' expressions. 
    "Term(x)" notation can be used instead of backtick quotes for complex term 
    names.

Version: 1.10.7 (2014-09-24)
(fixed) coef.multinom: gave a wrong order of coefficients for multiple level 
    responses (thanks to Alistair Senior who spotted this)

Version: 1.10.6 (2014-08-17)
(added) methods for 'maxlike' (from package with the same name)
lazy loading of datasets
plot.model.selection: improved and documented 

Version: 1.10.5 (2014-08-08)
get.models: can now use parallel computation if a valid 'cluster' is provided.
    It takes over the functionality of 'pget.models', which is now deprecated. 
    Also, the argument 'subset' must be now explicitely provided (so all models 
    are no longer fitted by default).

Version: 1.10.4 (2014-08-02)
(fixed) importance, model.avg: wrong order of 'N containing models' attribute
    (bug reported by Alba Estrada)
r.squaredGLMM: should be considerably faster and memory efficient due to 
    improved calculation of random effects variance (slow performance with large 
    datasets reported by Daniel Ezra Johnson).

Version: 1.10.3 (2014-06-27)
(fixed) dredge: no longer drops random term in 'glmmadmb' models (spotted by 
    Carlos Le¢n)

Version: 1.10.2
mystery update
    
Version: 1.10.1 (2014-05-19)
dredge: more meaningful warning message about misspecified 'fixed' argument
pdredge: synchronized code with 'dredge'
documentation: improved formatting

Version: 1.10.0 (2014-05-02)
r.squaredGLMM: throws an error if contrasts that have been used for random 
    factors in the "merMod" model do not match the ones in model matrix. This 
    happens if there are factors in random slope formula and user has changed 
    relevant 'options(contrasts)' since the model was fitted.
dredge: 'na.action' checking now allows "option(na.action)" to be a function and 
    not only character string.

Version: 1.9.26 (2014-03-16)
(fixed) dredge: when columns/rows in a subset matrix were in different order 
    than model terms, the values became wrongly rearranged (spotted by 
    a certain Frank on Stackoverflow).

Version: 1.9.25 (2014-03-13)
(added) methods for 'cpglm' and 'cpglmm' (from package 'cplm') (suggested by 
    Andrew Cooper)

Version: 1.9.24 (2014-02-26)
(fixed) 'getAllTerms.unmarkedFit' gave error when 'alpha' was estimated in 
    pcount model (reported by Lindsey Garner)

Version: 1.9.23 (2014-02-24)
(added) methods 'model.matrix' and 'model.frame' for 'lme', because the default 
    ones give wrong results when there is 'subset' or 'contrasts' set, or 
    'na.omit'ting.

Version: 1.9.22 (2014-02-20)
r.squaredGLMM: can be now applied to models with random slopes (based on idea 
    and R code by Paul Johnson). Added calculation of conditional R^2 for 
    Poisson family models.

Version: 1.9.21 (2014-02-17)
logLik.asreml: number of estimated parameters ('df') is now calculated as the
    number of fixed effect coefficients + number of variance parameters
    (non-fixed and non-constained). This gives comparable numbers to similar
    lmer models. In 'Asreml-R manual', however, only the number of variance
    components is used as K for AIC calculation (page 15). The log-likelihood
    values of asreml are far different from those from lmer(REML = TRUE), even
    though coefficients are very close. Note also that REstricted-likelihood is
    returned, so model comparisions based on it are invalid.
r.squaredGLMM: checks if it is applied to a random intercepts model, otherwise
    error is given. This is a limitation of the original formula by Nakagawa &
    Schiezlich.

Version: 1.9.20 (2014-02-12)
(added) methods for 'phylolm' (suggestion by Rafael Maia)

Version: 1.9.19 (2013-12-21)
(added) 'merge.model.selection' combines two 'model.selection' tables. Note that
    this is different than 'merge' for 'data.frame's (requested by Rafael Maia)

Version: 1.9.18 (2013-12-18)
(added) methods for 'asreml' model (in commercial package 'asreml'). Note this 
    has not been tested extensively (thanks to Emeline Mourocq for an incentive 
    and testing)

Version: 1.9.17 (2013-12-14)
full-averaged coefficients and standard errors are now calculated by 'model.avg' 
    and relevant methods (argument full = TRUE) (suggested by Candan Soykan)
importance: result gives now also number of models containg each variable

Version: 1.9.16 (2013-11-24)
model.sel: now accepts arguments 'extra' and 'beta', like 'dredge' (requested by
    D. Duro on R-Forge).

Version: 1.9.15 (2013-11-17)
[p]dredge: improved checking for whether the global model removes missing data
    (na.action = "na.omit" or "na.exclude"). Note that code working with
    previous versions may give you an error now, setting options(na.action =
    "na.fail") prevents it.

Version: 1.9.14 (2013-11-03)
(added) support for 'betareg' (from package 'betareg') (suggested by Marie-Line
    Gentes)
(added) support for 'aodml' and 'aodql' (from package 'aods3') (suggested by 
    Renaud Lancelot)
[p]dredge: fixed a bug that occurred when there was 'na.action=na.omit' in
    global model (spotted by Laura Busia on R-help).

Version: 1.9.13 (2013-10-28)
(fixed) handling response variables with more than two levels in 
    'nnet::multinom' models (reported by Ludo Duvaux on Stackoverflow)

Version: 1.9.12 (2013-10-21)
further adjustments to deal with unavailability of 'lme4' on CRAN

Version: 1.9.11 (2013-09-30)
Documentation: examples that depend on suggested packages have been made 
    conditional on availability of the package
getCall method for 'model.selection' can retrieve a component model call if 
    index is given as a second argument.

Version: 1.9.10 (2013-08-27)
pdredge: removed global assignments (within cluster nodes).

Version: 1.9.9 (2013-05-21)
(fixed) beta.weights: bug with dimensions dropped (spotted by Dennis Duro, 
    thanks to Ben Bolker for tracking it down)

Version: 1.9.8 (2013-05-02)
(fixed) handling bar in formulas for 'hurdle' class of models (reported by 
    Jean-Yves Barnagaud)

Version: 1.9.7 (2013-04-19)
dredge: 'subset' expression now recognizes ".(x)" notation to indicate a 
    variable rather than a model term. Error message from within a 'rank' 
    function gives now a more meaningfull call (apparently it is a common 
    mistake to have some misspelled arguments that get passed to 'rank' function 
    through '...').

Version: 1.9.6 (2013-04-12)
model.sel: better model naming in the result table
(fixed) logLik.coxme: 'nobs' attribute now uses a correct number of observations 
    (model$n[2]). "penalized" log-lik. is the default type now (Note that 
    "logLik.coxme"'s argument "type" is undocumented).

Version: 1.9.5 (2013-04-04)
(fixed) AICc: now takes number of observations from "nall" (if it is available)
    attribute of the 'logLik' object. If not present, "nobs" attribute is used.
r.squaredGLMM: current implementation does not calculate the marginal variant
    correctly for Poisson family models, so until it is resolved 'NA' is
    returned, with a warning.
    
Version: 1.9.4 (2013-04-01)
(fixed) pdredge: bug with wrong number of updated rows.
Replaced all calls to the soon-to-be deprecated ".find.package" with
    "find.package".

Version: 1.9.3 (2013-02-21)
(fixed) method registration for 'getAllTerms.gam' was missing (reported by 
    Steven Delean).

Version: 1.9.2 (2013-02-01)
updateable: new function to create a wrapper for functions returning
    non-updateable objects (adds a 'call' element to the function's result).
(renamed) removed 'gamm' wrapper, which is now replaced by 'uGamm'.
(added) 'predict' method replacement for 'gls' models (adds 'se.fit' argument).
model.avg: no longer returns residuals (this is because residuals for models
    other than 'lm' can be calculated in several different ways - with different
    results).

Version: 1.9.1 (2013-01-24)
(fixed) bugs with 'MCMCglmm' models and 'varying' lists in 'dredge'.

Version: 1.9.0 (2013-01-23)
This version brings in more elaborated subsetting of models in 'dredge' and 
    'model.selection' object, and a new variant of pseudo-R^2. 
[p]dredge: 'subset' can use 'varying' variables (as "V(varying.variable)") and
    number of model terms (as `*nvar*`). This allows for better fine-tuning of
    the selection table.
    'fixed' argument can be set to TRUE to fix all terms of 'global.model'.
[p]dredge, subset.model.selection: 'subset' expressions can now make use of a 
    new function 'dc' ("dependency chain") to make inclusion of variables 
    conditional on other variables.
r.squaredGLMM: new function to calculate R^2 statistic for mixed effect models,
    described by Nakagawa & Schiezlich (2012).
(added) support for 'splm' (from package 'splm'), and 'logistf' models (from 
    package 'logistf').
Cp: now accepts more than one model (like 'AIC').
New demos "dredge.varying", "dredge.subset" and "gees".

Version: 1.8.2 (2012-12-07)
(added) support for models of class 'mark' (from package 'RMark'). 'dredge'
    can currently only manipulate 'formula' element of argument
    'model.parameters'.
simplify.formula, expand.formula: new functions to convert formula between 
    expanded and shorthand notation (i.e. between 'a+b+a:b' and 'a*b').
model.names: has new argument "use.letters".

Version: 1.8.1 (2012-11-23)
(added) methods for class 'merMod' to accommodate recent changes in 
    lme4_0.99999911-0.
getAllTerms: now recognizes random effects in 'MCMCglmm'.

Version: 1.8.0 (2012-11-21)
This version introduces support for GEE models ('gee','geeglm' and 'yags') 
    ranked by QIC (note that 'yags' seems to be still quite buggy).
    Also 'clmm' and 'clm' from package 'ordinal' are now handled properly.
QIC, quasiLik: new functions for use with GEE models.
[p]dredge: argument 'subset' can be now a logical matrix representing allowed 
    parameter combinations. Some improvements for speed have been made.
[p]dredge, model.avg: new argument 'ct.args' for passing extra arguments 
    to 'coefTable'.

Version: 1.7.12 (2012-11-11)
tests/classes.R: fixed compatibility spdep-0.5.53. (spdep::spautolm now uses 
    method = "eigen", was "full") 

Version: 1.7.11 (2012-07-13)
coefTable.multinom: fixed an error when coefficients and standard errors were 
    matrices.
get.models: now checks for the object class of the passed arguments.

Version: 1.7.10 (2012-06-07)
(fixed) dredge: bug with an error message when number of predictor exceeded 
    maximum (thanks to Corina Logan for spotting this).
manual: added 'glmmADMB' to the list of supported classes (reported by Rocio 
    Jana).
'coxme' moved from 'Suggested' to 'Enhances' (to avoid build error when the
    dependency is missing).

Version: 1.7.9 (2012-04-03)
(added) 'predict' methods for 'lme' and 'lmer' (both can calculate 'se.fit').
    'predict.lme' is a wrapper for its namesake from 'nlme' package (it is
    not exported, so it's visibility depends on the order the packages were 
    loaded - but is always visible from MuMIn namespace).

Version: 1.7.8 (2012-04-01)
(fixed) 'coef.model.selection' returns now proper coefficients

Version: 1.7.7 (2012-04-01)
(fixed) dependencies in tests

Version: 1.7.6 (2012-04-01)
dredge: with nested formula designs, 'marg.ex' is now found automatically
predict.averaging: is now more flexible in how the predictions from generalized
    models are calculated (new attribute "backtransform").

Version: 1.7.5 (2012-03-27)
(added) methods for 'MCMCglmm' class, and function 'DIC': works with 'model.sel'
    and 'dredge' (but not 'model.avg').
'unmarked' is removed from 'Suggested' packages (recently it is often 
    unavailable on CRAN and causes errors during R CHECK). Added workarounds to 
    pass (=cheat) the R CHECK.

Version: 1.7.3 (2012-02-01)
(added) methods for 'glimML' class from package 'aod'

Version: 1.7.2 (2012-01-30)
(fixed) 'nobs.coxme' returned the number of events was returned rather than 
    the number of observations.
(fixed) 'coefTable' gave an error for 'coxph' null model.
(fixed) 'r.squaredLR' was evaluating the null model for 'lme' in a wrong 
    environment.
(fixed) 'getAllTerms' method for 'zeroinfl' was not registered.
dredge: checks each generated model for the correct number of observations.


Version: 1.7.1 (2012-01-26)
(added) methods for 'hurdle' and 'zeroinfl' classes (package 'pscf').
coef, coefTable: new methods to extract coefficients from model selection 
    tables.
Documentation: list of supported models put into a separate page.

Version: 1.7.0 (2012-01-25)
This version adds possibility to model average and re-rank (with another IC) a 
    model selection table without recreating the fitted models. Models from 
    package 'coxme' are now supported. Model selection tables include now extra 
    columns showing differences in attributes of the modelling function call.
model.avg: use 'model.selection' without refitting the models. Fixed a problem 
    with averaging different types of models together (happened when 'df's were 
    available only for some of component models).
dredge: coefficient tables added to the result (attribute "coefTables"). The 
    code has been simplified.
print.model.selection: now reports random terms also for objects generated by
    'model.sel'.
get.models: can handle 'model.selection' objects from 'model.sel'
model.sel: re-ranking 'model.selection' without recreating original models 
    (works only if the IC can be applied to logLik). Output has additional 
    columns showing differences between models (based on call's arguments)
(added) generic methods for 'coxme' and 'lmekin' classes (package 'coxme').

Version: 1.6.6 (2012-01-07)
model.avg: fixed error occurring when non-estimable coefficients existed in the 
    component models (problem reported by Annabel Smith)

Version: 1.6.5 (2011-11-28)
pdredge example changed to use SOCK cluster type (portability issue).

Version: 1.6.4 (2011-11-26)
coefTable: replaces 'tTable' (which still exists, but is deprecated), it 
    accepts an argument 'dispersion'. The dispersion parameter can be also 
    passed from 'model.avg'.
pdredge: collects all the warnings and errors which occur during fitting, and 
    stores them. They are printed below the table.
    The function does more thorough checking of the cluster nodes' environment,
    for possible missing variables and functions.
get.models:  "subset" argument can be now a character vector giving model names.
(added) demos for model selection with models from 'unmarked' package using 
    'dredge' and 'pdredge'.

Version: 1.6.3 (2011-11-15)
pget.models: new function, parallel version of 'get.models'.
(p)get.models: important change of the default behaviour: without the 'subset' 
    argument, ALL models are returned. Also the '...' arguments were not used to
    update the returned models - this is corrected now.

Version: 1.6.2 (2011-11-13)
pdredge: new function, a parallel version of dredge (experimental).

Version: 1.6.1 (2011-11-11)
dredge: added generic support for all 'unmarked' models, and fixed some bugs 
    with it.
model.names: new function (previously was internal only)
CAICF: adds to the collection of rarely used information criteria.

Version: 1.6.0 (2011-11-07)
dredge: most important change (although invisible to the user) is in the way the
    model objects are updated. The new function 'makeArgs' is used to generate 
    the updated call. This results in a very flexible interface to the modelling
    functions. The default method updates the 'formula' argument, other methods 
    can be used to deal with more problematic calls (the models from package 
    'unmarked' were a challenge). Apart from the model classes previously
    supported by 'dredge', support for 'unmarkedFitOccu', 'unmarkedFitColExt'
    and several other 'unmarkedFit' objects has been added.
dredge: has new argument 'extra' to add additional statistics into the model 
    selection table.
r.squared: new function to calculate likelihood-ratio based pseudo-R-squared
subset method for 'model.selection': accepts a shorthand notation "has(x)" to 
    select rows where a variable is present.

fixed: method="NA" in model.avg, par.avg now accepts NA's in 'weight'

Version: 0.12.0 (2009-03-24)
Change in version number only. Had to make this jump in numbering, as there was
a typo in DESCRIPTION file of an early version, (0.11.2 instead of 0.1.0), and
since then R-forge mechanism seemed to ignore actual newer versions, as they had
lower number.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-22)
Modified: dredge: added "fixed" and "m.max" arguments.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root
of variance). Thanks to Mick Wu.
Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations, so
now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

Version 0.1.0
dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, its name changed
to MuMIn (from MUlti Model INference).
