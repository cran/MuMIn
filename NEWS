MuMIn package news:


Changes in version 1.47.5 (2023-03-15)
- r.squaredGLMM: added support for additional families using 
  insight::get_variance. This requires the addition of 'insight' to the package 
  dependencies, something done very reluctantly as, as a principle with MuMIn, 
  new dependencies are only added as a last resort.
- null.fit and hence r.squaredLR now work also with "survreg" class (reported by
  Caroline Zanchi).

Changes in version 1.47.4 (2023-03-13)
- (fixed) removed remaining references to stats:::format.perc

Changes in version 1.47.3 (2023-02-27)
- (fixed) model.avg.default: duplicated interaction coefficients were returned
  when the main effect coefficients appeared in different order in the 
  component models (spotted by Derek Corcoran).

Changes in version 1.47.2 (2023-01-06)
- Updated methods for models of class 'Sarlm' and 'Spautolm' from the 
  package 'spatialreg' (reported by Iwona Dembicz)

Changes in version 1.47.1 (2022-08-31)
- Pleasing RCheck: updated NEWS file so that it can be parsed by the 
  `news` function.

Changes in version 1.47.0 (2022-08-30)
- (changed) plot.model.selection: Most notable change is the way the 
  'col' argument is interpreted. The default colours use now 
  `hcl.palette` and differ from the previous version. There is no backward 
  compatibility.
- Long defunct `mod.sel`, `tTable` and `updateable2` have been removed.
  `importance` is now defunct (use `sw` instead).

Changes in version 1.46.7 (2022-08-24)
- Rd files have been updated to meet changes in the HTML R help system, 
  starting with R 4.2.0. Hence, the minimum required version of R is now 
  4.2.0.

Changes in version 1.46.6 (2022-07-31)
- (fixed) print.model.selection: Abbreviations now only include existing        
  values (i.e. after subsetting).
- (fixed) merge.model.selection: "modelList" attributes are now preserved.

Changes in version 1.46.5 (2022-06-07)
- (fixed) getAllTerms.gamlss: error with intercept only models and formulas
  containing offset (reported multiple times on Stackoverflow)

Changes in version 1.46.4 (2022-06-07)
- (fixed) dredge: in a rare case when intercept terms were passed as "fixed", 
  some variable combinations were erroneously dropped from the result. 

Changes in version 1.46.0 (2022-02-23)
- (fixed) r.squaredGLMM: now gives correct values for negative binomial models
  (thanks to Shuang Zhang for research)

Changes in version 1.45.1 (2021-12-08)
- (added) .vcov a wrapper for vcov returning result in a consistent format (a
  matrix)

Changes in version 1.45.0 (2021-11-25)
- pdredge is deprecated in favour of `dredge` with "cluster" argument.

Changes in version 1.44.6 (2021-05-19)
- added stringsAsFactors=TRUE to most 'as.data.frame' occurences to bring back 
  the desired behaviour (which changed in R 4.0.0).

Changes in version 1.44.5 (2021-05-11)
- std.coef: now matches coefficient names with model matrix column names.

Changes in version 1.44.4 (2021-04-20)
- coefTable.betareg - now includes residual df.

Changes in version 1.44.3 (2021-03-05)
- (fixed) getAllTerms.zeroinfl: error when the function was called from 
  non-global environment (spotted by Richard Shefferson)

Changes in version 1.44.2 (2020-07-14)
- (fixed) error with makeArgs (and hence dredge) with glmmTMB with non-symbol 
  response

Changes in version 1.44.1 (2020-06-25)
- importance: is now formally deprecated with a warning. Use `sw` instead.

Changes in version 1.44.0 (2020-05-28)
- (added) plot method for the class "averaging" produces a dot-and-whisker plot
  of coefficients. This uses a new general function `coefplot` that can be used 
  to make plots for arbitrary model types.

Changes in version 1.43.19 (2020-05-22)
- (fixed) plot titles in plot.coefTable

Changes in version 1.43.18 (2020-05-18)
- r.squaredGLMM: issues a warning about zero-inflation and dispersion model 
  being ignored in the calculation of R2 rather than an error as before (request 
  from Alexander Bruckner, inspired by the code by Ben Bolker:
  https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/blob/master/glmmTMB/inst/misc/rsqglmm.R) 
- (fixed) some issues with evaluating in non-global environment (`updateable` 
  and 'na.action' checking)

Changes in version 1.43.17 (2020-04-14)
- Merely refreshing date stamp to please CRAN policies.

Changes in version 1.43.16 (2020-03-12)
- (added) specs for 'unmarkedFitPCount' with mixture = "ZIP" (spotted by Hannah 
  Clyde)

Changes in version 1.43.15 (2019-12-19)
- (fixed) fatal error with QIC.geem introduced in the previous version
  (reported by Lee McDaniel)

Changes in version 1.43.14 (2019-12-18)
- (fixed) example(QIC) causing an error after recent update of 'geepack'.
- Added quasiLik/QIC for the negative binomial family (reportedly supported only 
  by 'geeM::geem').

Changes in version 1.43.13 (2019-12-14)
- (fixed) get.models: in the absence of a 'global model', the argument 'subset' 
  was ignored and a list of all models was returned. 

Changes in version 1.43.12 (2019-12-11)
- (fixed) [p]dredge: error while formatting the error message about an overlarge 
  number of predictors (found by a certain 89_Simple on Stackoverflow).

Changes in version 1.43.11 (2019-12-09)
- (fixed) getAllTerms now recognizes structured terms of form 
  `struc(terms|group)` properly as random effect terms;
- (fixed) dredge, model.sel: delta was not calculated if any rank was NA.

Changes in version 1.43.10 (2019-12-05)
- (removed) conflicting methods which are now defined in their 'survival' 
  package (nobs.coxph, nobs.survreg). Because of that, MuMIn now depends on 
  survival >= 3.1.0.

Changes in version 1.43.9 (2019-06-21)
- (fixed) 'r.squaredGLMM' failed when order of interaction components in RE part
  of model formula were not in order of appearance (found by
  Gabriel Baud-Bovy)
- (removed) 'predict.merMod' replacement to avoid the conflict of registered
  methods. Note that the original method does not calculate 'se.fit', so
  currently there is no out-of-box way to produce averaged predictions with
  standard errors.

Changes in version 1.43.8 (2019-04-15)
- (fixed) methods for 'gamlss' (reported by Andras Farkas)

Changes in version 1.43.6 (2019-04-08)
- (fixed) if conditions with "length > 1 in coercion to logical" error produced 
  by the new Rcheck.
- (fixed) updated 'tests' to make up for 'spautolm' moved from 'spdep' to 
  'spatialreg'.

Changes in version 1.43.4 (2019-04-04)
- (fixed) minor changes to the quasi-likelihood function

Changes in version 1.43.3 (2019-03-19)
- (added) methods for 'gamlss' (suggested by Anne Loosen)
- (fixed) QIC,quasiLik: now gives results compatible with those of 
  wgeesel::QIC.gee.

Changes in version 1.43.2 (2019-03-16)
- 'sw' (for "Sum of Weights") is now preferred to 'importance' (which is still
  available, but is going to be deprecated in future). This is because of the
  controversies about SoW being a valid measure of actual variable importance.
- [p]dredge: max. number of predictors is now correctly calculated (depending on 
  the number of variants)

Changes in version 1.43.1 (2019-03-06)
- (added) new model structure for unmarkedFitGDS (gdistsamp) with alpha
  parameter (thanks to Alba Estrada)

Changes in version 1.43.0 (2019-02-28)
- (fixed) in QICu, the number of parameters was mistaken for number of 
  observations (reported by Richard Fredrickson)
- (added) some methods for wgeesel::wgee objects.

Changes in version 1.42.5 (2019-01-02)
- r.squaredGLMM: added the argument "envir" which is passed to `.nullFitRE`. 
  This can be used in case of issues with model data not being found (reported 
  by Eliot McIntire)

Changes in version 1.42.4 (2018-12-05)
- (fixed) r.squaredGLMM.merMod: error when the function was called in an
  environment different than .GlobalEnv (spotted by a certain Martin on
  Stackoverflow)

Changes in version 1.42.3 (2018-07-31)
- (added) dredge: the subset expression `.(x)` now accepts an additional
  argument for the allowed term orders. For example `.(X, 2:10)` means "at least
  one 2nd or 3rd order interaction of 'X'". The `.` pseudo-function has also a
  new alias: "with", e.g. `with(X, 2:10)`.

Changes in version 1.42.2 (2018-07-27)
- (fixed) r.squaredGLMM: handle the case when some coefficients are not
  estimated and NA

Changes in version 1.42.1 (2018-07-21)
- tests have been modified to prevent CRAN check errors on some systems. 
- (fixed) arm.glm, armWeights: now use a random sample to select a training set.
  armWeights: no longer give a warning about "longer object length" 
	
Changes in version 1.42.0 (2018-07-17)
- (updated) methods for "unmarkedFit" models have been rewritten and should work
  properly with all subclasses. Added missing support for
  "unmarked::unmarkedFitOccuFP" (reported by Tara Hohoff)
- R2GLMM added an option to disable "null fit warning"
- (fixed) getAllTerms.lme: now gives a correct value for response in "binomial" 
  glmmPQL ("zz" previously)
- (fixed) testSmoothKConsistency: (used by `model.avg` with 'gam' models) works 
  now with 'gam's including no smooth terms.

Changes in version 1.41.1 (2018-07-13)
- (fixed) workaround for clmm's (package "ordinal") annoyance: it needs explicit 
  "1" in the formula if there are no other fixed terms. That resulted in 
  intercept-only model calls generated by `dredge` being rejected. 
  (kindly reported by Jörg Albrecht)

Changes in version 1.41.0 (2018-07-12)
- (updated) r.squaredGLMM: revised to incorporate new developments in 
  Nakagawa et al (2017). Methods exist for merMod, glmmTMB, glmmADMB, glmmPQL,
  cpglmm, and lm classes.

Changes in version 1.40.8 (2018-06-18)
- Model description - simplified handling of the model's family description in
  the model selection tables, so it does not require `family()$family` string
  being an existing function name. The drawback is that now a default link
  function is not detected and its name always appears in the column (before
  e.g. "binomial(logit)" appeared as "binomial()").

Changes in version 1.40.7 (2018-06-14)
- Addad a workaround to accommodate glmmTMB specific families (which do not have 
  a matching function) (reported by a certain Gitu on Stackoverflow)

Changes in version 1.40.6 (2018-05-16)
- (fixed) makeArgs, getAllTerms: compatibility with glmmTMB - random terms in 
  formulas other than cond have not been handled properly (discovered via 
  Mollie Brooks on GitHub)

Changes in version 1.40.5 (2018-05-14)
- `.checkNAAction` now handles a case of 'na.action' formal argument being a
  call (e.g. `getOption(na.action)` in glmmTMB) (spotted by Ben Bolker)

Changes in version 1.40.4 (2018-01-30)
- Elaborated the Description field.

Changes in version 1.40.3 (2018-01-29)
- Removed superfluous method replacements for models from package "survival".
  `predict` functions for "gls" and "lme" are no longer registered as S3 
  methods in NAMESPACE.

Changes in version 1.40.2 (2018-01-19)
- (fixed) getAllTerms.glmmTMB: error with models including offset term 
  (spotted by Kate Plummer)

Changes in version 1.40.1 (2017-11-30)
- (added) Support for "glmmTMB" models (incentive from Kaitlyn Zerr)

Changes in version 1.40.0 (2017-09-30)
- (fixed) long broken support for "unmarkedFit" models has been restored 
  (because of the utterly inconsistent structure of these objects it is not 
  guaranteed to work in all cases).
- (fixed) R.squaredGLMM: error with very long RE formulas (reported by Siti
  Binte Faizal)

Changes in version 1.16.7 (2017-08-10)
- A few minor things fixed.

Changes in version 1.16.6 (2017-07-11)
- (fixed) print.summary.averaging: warning when fitting function name was a call 
  rather than a symbol, e.g. lme4::lme (reported by Chen Lei).

Changes in version 1.16.5 (2017-05-24)
- (fixed) predict.gls updated to match current version in nlme (reported by a 
  certain Asteraceae on Stackoverflow)

Changes in version 1.16.4 (2016-11-21)
- (fixed) makeArgs.mark: reverted to a working version (this bug was introduced
  in 1.15.2/rev. 373. Reported by Jay Rotella)

Changes in version 1.16.3 (2016-09-14)
- (fixed) dredge: recognizes when global model's data is a function in a smarter 
  way

Changes in version 1.16.2 (2016-09-01)
- (fixed) plot.model.selection: problem in case with only one model in the table
  (reported by Ryan Rothman on Stackoverflow)
- dredge: recognizes when global model's data is a function (which is not
  allowed as it may cause sub-models being fitted to different datasets)

Changes in version 1.16.1 (2016-07-29)
- New suite of functions to support model averaging. It is based on original
  code developed by Carsten Dormann, as an outcome of the model-averaging
  workshop held in Freiburg in 2015.
- (added) cos2Weights, BGWeights, jackknifeWeights, stackingWeights: calculate
  various types of model weights.
- (added) loo: RMSE/log-likelihood based on leave-one-out cross-validation
- (added) armWeights: similar to `arm.glm` but produces model weights.
- (fixed) model.avg/model.sel: problems with intercept only models
  (spotted by a certain Teresa on Stackoverflow)

Changes in version 1.15.8 (2016-07-05)
- (fixed) dredge: no longer produces an error in the rare case when dependency
  matrix was an empty matrix [0x0].
- (fixed) r.squaredGLMM: error with naming of variance components in 'lmer'
  models. (both problems reported by a certain Teresa on Stackoverflow)
- (added) Weights: has an assignment version, so weights can be applied to an
  "averaging" object.
- get.models: now can extract models also from an "averaging" object (only when
  it was created with model objects).

Changes in version 1.15.7 (2016-01-21)
- (fixed) dredge: number of variables is limited to 30 to avoid integer overflow
  (reported by Sarah Grogan).

Changes in version 1.15.6 (2015-12-21)
- (fixed) get.models, dredge, subset.model.selection: enclosure for the subset
  expression evaluation is now `parent.frame()` rather than `.GlobalEnv` as it
  was before (incentive from Philipp Maier).
- (fixed) coeffs.survreg, coefTable.survreg: log(scale) added to coefficients,
  when it is estimated (suggested by Nicolas Rode).

Changes in version 1.15.5 (2015-11-25)
- (fixed) [p]dredge: error with model with offsets in formula when 'subset'
  expression was given (reported by Adam Cummings)
- (fixed) [p]dredge: in some cases the generated combinations did not obey the
  subset matrix (reported by Ben Augustine)
- (fixed) model.selection column assignment "[<-" was broken when (spotted by a
  certain abmiller8 on Stackoverflow)
- model.avg: warns when averaged 'gam' models have smooths with different
  dimension for the same variable.

Changes in version 1.15.4 (2015-10-16)
- (fixed) rbind, merge methods for "model.selection": wrong order of names of
  columns and rows (spotted by Ben Augustine)

Changes in version 1.15.3 (2015-09-06)
- (fixed) Weights: bug that caused that NaN's were returned (reported by Carles
  Alcaraz)

Changes in version 1.15.2 (2015-07-07)
- (added) summary.coefTable: tries to calculate p-values for coefficients, nicer
  printing using printCoefmat

Changes in version 1.15.1 (2015-07-02)
- added imports from all the default packages added to NAMESPACE in order to
  satisfy CRAN's new stricter RCheck.

Changes in version 1.15.0 (2015-07-01)
- (added) arm.glm: implements model averaging with weights calculated via ARM
  ("adaptive regression by mixing") algorithm.
- "averaging" object: the elements "coef.shrinkage" and "coefTable" are replaced
  by matrix named "coefficients". The "Pval-tables" are accessed via
  summary(averaging)'s elements "coefmat.full" and "coefmat.subset". Objects
  created with previous versions will be automatically converted if needed.
- [p]dredge: argument 'm.lim' replaces 'm.min' and 'm.max' (which are still
  present, but deprecated).
- "model.selection" object: changing or removing essential columns (i.e.
  everything except 'varying' and 'extra') converts the object to a plain
  "data.frame" and drops all additional attributes.
- (added) rbind.model.selection: combine multiple "model.selection" objects.
- (added) 'xtable' methods for "averaging" and "model.selection" objects.
- (fixed) updateable: does not cause infinite recursion when the resulting
  wrapper has the same name as the wrapped function.
- (fixed) exprApply: now can deal with function expressions and 'expression's
  longer than one.

Changes in version 1.14.1 (2015-06-12)
- (fixed) [p]dredge no longer gives coefficient values as NA with [g]lmer
  (reported by Aitor Cevidanes).
- Some tidying-up of manual and data (response in 'Cement' and 'Beetle' moved to
  first column so that formula(data) is correct).

Changes in version 1.14.0 (2015-06-03)
- (added) partial.sd, std.coef: calculate partial std. deviation and standardize
  model coefficients. 'beta.weights' is now deprecated in favour of
  'std.coef'.
- dredge, model.avg, model.sel: argument 'beta' is modified to allow for
  standardizing with SD or partial SD.
- coefTable, coeffs: method for class 'aodml' (package 'aod3') no longer return
  'phi' coefficients. This is for consistency with results of 'vcov' and
  'coef', as well as their counterparts for 'glimML' models.
- Removed all methods for 'mer' objects (used in lme4 < 1.0.0)

Changes in version 1.13.10 (2015-06-01)
- (fixed) compatibility with lme4-1.1.8, 'null.fit' now works properly with
  'gamm' objects.

Changes in version 1.13.9 (2015-05-28)
- stdize: improved interpretation of the argument "scale".
- new dataset "GPA" ("First-year college Grade Point Average" referred in
  Burnham & Anderson (2002)).

Changes in version 1.13.8 (2015-05-22)
- (added) QIC support for 'geem' models (request from Lee McDaniel).

Changes in version 1.13.7 (2015-05-14)
- coefTable: method for 'averaging' objects gains new arguments "full" and
  "adjust.se".
- (fixed) getAllTerms: now correctly names coefficients of 'unmarked::gdistsamp'
  models (reported by Nathan Hostetter)

Changes in version 1.13.6 (2015-05-01)
- (fixed) model.avg, model.sel: now better distinguish model objects from lists
  of objects.

Changes in version 1.13.5 (2015-04-15)
- (fixed) r.squaredGLMM: method for 'lme' class with a multilevel grouping
  structure (reported by Alex Gunderson)

Changes in version 1.13.4 (2015-02-24)
- coefTable.coxph: added workaround for the case when variance-covariance matrix
  is NA (as in results of 'intcox') (reported by Vanessa Boukili)

Changes in version 1.13.3 (2015-02-19)
- get.models+subset.model.selection: unified 'subset' expression interpretation
- dredge: no longer exceeds memory limit with very complex models, and its
  efficiency has somewhat improved. With trace=2 a progress bar is displayed.
- model.sel: has new attribute 'fit'.
- "averaging" object now stores component models.
- model.sel,subset,get.models: unified interpretation of the "subset" expression
- (fixed) extracting random effects formula (affected 'r.squaredGLMM' for
  'lmer', reported by Yevgen Matusevych)
- (fixed) makeArgs (and hence 'dredge'): formulas with no intercept are now
  handled correctly in 'zeroinfl' models.

Changes in version 1.13.2 (2015-01-08)
- (fixed) makeArgs (and hence 'dredge'): gave error if no random effects was
  specified in 'glmmadmb' model (reported by Szymek Drobniak).

Changes in version 1.13.1 (2015-01-06)
- (fixed) getAllTerms: now properly handles single formula in 'hurdle' and
  'zeroinfl' models (package 'pscl').

Changes in version 1.13.0 (2015-01-03)
- (added) get.response: utility to extract response variable.

Changes in version 1.12.4 (2014-12-26)
- (added) stdizeFit: utility to modify model object or a call to modelling
  function to use standardized data.

Changes in version 1.12.3 (2014-12-23)
- (fixed) checkModels: workaround for the "dotted argument identity" issue 
  (namely sometimes equal "..1"s are not identical).

Changes in version 1.12.2 (2014-12-19)
- (fixed) [Q]AICc: previously they ignored REML argument for some model classes.
  The code has been rewritten so that most of the core calculation is done by
  a common internal function.

Changes in version 1.12.1 (2014-12-16)
- minor corrections to the documentation

Changes in version 1.12.0 (2014-12-16)
- (added) exprApply: new function to manipulate expressions (with example of use
  with 'dredge' to manipulate terms inside formula).
- dredge, subset.model.selection: curly braces can be used to indicate complex
  terms (e.g. {I(x)} or {s(x,k=2}) instead of backtick quotes. Spacing in these
  expressions is irrelevant (as both whitespace and backticks seem to be a
  problem for some users).

Changes in version 1.11.3 (2014-12-10)
- (added) stdize: new function for standardizing data
- (fixed) smarter sorting of interaction terms in coefficient names
- print.model.selection: rank function call is added to the output

Changes in version 1.11.2 (2014-12-01)
- (fixed) r.squaredGLMM: in "binomial" family models the residual variance is
  used for additive dispersion (thanks to Paul Johnson). There is still issue
  with 'lmer' with 'subset' argument, and observation-level random term has to
  be specified manually.
- (fixed) some formula-decomposition related functions (that sometimes caused
  problems with 'r.squaredGLMM' for 'lmer', reported by Yevgen Matusevych)
- dredge: warns about potentially misspecified arguments
- (added) predict method for 'gamm' class

Changes in version 1.11.1 (2014-11-19)
- dredge: more efficient checking for marginality in model terms (~10x faster in
  case of 4-way interaction). The argument 'marg.ex' is removed (exceptions to
  marginality rule are inferred from the global model).
- getAllTerms: result has a new attribute 'deps' with a "term dependency matrix".
- nested: new function listing nested models (suggested by Giacomo Assandri).
- updateable: added new argument 'eval.args'

Changes in version 1.10.8 (2014-11-14)
- dredge, subset.model.selection: improved interpretation of 'subset' expressions.
  "Term(x)" notation can be used instead of backtick quotes for complex term
  names.

Changes in version 1.10.7 (2014-09-24)
- (fixed) coef.multinom: gave a wrong order of coefficients for multiple level
  responses (thanks to Alistair Senior who spotted this)

Changes in version 1.10.6 (2014-08-17)
- (added) methods for 'maxlike' (from package with the same name)
- lazy loading of datasets
- plot.model.selection: improved and documented

Changes in version 1.10.5 (2014-08-08)
- get.models: can now use parallel computation if a valid 'cluster' is provided.
  It takes over the functionality of 'pget.models', which is now deprecated.
  Also, the argument 'subset' must be now explicitely provided (so all models
  are no longer fitted by default).

Changes in version 1.10.4 (2014-08-02)
- (fixed) importance, model.avg: wrong order of 'N containing models' attribute
  (bug reported by Alba Estrada)
- r.squaredGLMM: should be considerably faster and memory efficient due to
  improved calculation of random effects variance (slow performance with large
  datasets reported by Daniel Ezra Johnson).

Changes in version 1.10.3 (2014-06-27)
- (fixed) dredge: no longer drops random term in 'glmmadmb' models (spotted by
  Carlos Le¢n)

Changes in version 1.10.2
- mystery update

Changes in version 1.10.1 (2014-05-19)
- dredge: more meaningful warning message about misspecified 'fixed' argument
- pdredge: synchronized code with 'dredge'
- documentation: improved formatting

Changes in version 1.10.0 (2014-05-02)
- r.squaredGLMM: throws an error if contrasts that have been used for random
  factors in the "merMod" model do not match the ones in model matrix. This
  happens if there are factors in random slope formula and user has changed
  relevant 'options(contrasts)' since the model was fitted.
- dredge: 'na.action' checking now allows "option(na.action)" to be a function
  and not only character string.

Changes in version 1.9.26 (2014-03-16)
- (fixed) dredge: when columns/rows in a subset matrix were in different order
  than model terms, the values became wrongly rearranged (spotted by a certain
  Frank on Stackoverflow).

Changes in version 1.9.25 (2014-03-13)
- (added) methods for 'cpglm' and 'cpglmm' (from package 'cplm') (suggested by
  Andrew Cooper)

Changes in version 1.9.24 (2014-02-26)
- (fixed) 'getAllTerms.unmarkedFit' gave error when 'alpha' was estimated in
  pcount model (reported by Lindsey Garner)

Changes in version 1.9.23 (2014-02-24)
- (added) methods 'model.matrix' and 'model.frame' for 'lme', because the
  default ones give wrong results when there is 'subset' or 'contrasts' set, or
  'na.omit'ting.

Changes in version 1.9.22 (2014-02-20)
- r.squaredGLMM: can be now applied to models with random slopes (based on idea
  and R code by Paul Johnson). Added calculation of conditional R^2 for Poisson
  family models.

Changes in version 1.9.21 (2014-02-17)
- logLik.asreml: number of estimated parameters ('df') is now calculated as the
  number of fixed effect coefficients + number of variance parameters (non-fixed
  and non-constained). This gives comparable numbers to similar lmer models. In
  'Asreml-R manual', however, only the number of variance components is used as
  K for AIC calculation (page 15). The log-likelihood values of asreml are far
  different from those from lmer(REML = TRUE), even though coefficients are very
  close. Note also that REstricted-likelihood is returned, so model comparisions
  based on it are invalid.
- r.squaredGLMM: checks if it is applied to a random intercepts model, otherwise
  error is given. This is a limitation of the original formula by Nakagawa and
  Schiezlich.

Changes in version 1.9.20 (2014-02-12)
- (added) methods for 'phylolm' (suggestion by Rafael Maia)

Changes in version 1.9.19 (2013-12-21)
- (added) 'merge.model.selection' combines two 'model.selection' tables. Note
  that this is different than 'merge' for 'data.frame's (requested by Rafael
  Maia)

Changes in version 1.9.18 (2013-12-18)
- (added) methods for 'asreml' model (in commercial package 'asreml'). Note this
  has not been tested extensively (thanks to Emeline Mourocq for an incentive
  and testing)

Changes in version 1.9.17 (2013-12-14)
- full-averaged coefficients and standard errors are now calculated by
  'model.avg' and relevant methods (argument full = TRUE) (suggested by Candan
  Soykan)
- importance: result gives now also number of models containg each variable.

Changes in version 1.9.16 (2013-11-24)
- model.sel: now accepts arguments 'extra' and 'beta', like 'dredge' (requested
  by D. Duro on R-Forge).

Changes in version 1.9.15 (2013-11-17)
- [p]dredge: improved checking for whether the global model removes missing data
  (na.action = "na.omit" or "na.exclude"). Note that code working with
  previous versions may give you an error now, setting options(na.action =
  "na.fail") prevents it.

Changes in version 1.9.14 (2013-11-03)
- (added) support for 'betareg' (from package 'betareg') (suggested by
  Marie-Line Gentes)
- (added) support for 'aodml' and 'aodql' (from package 'aods3') (suggested by
  Renaud Lancelot)
[p]dredge: fixed a bug that occurred when there was 'na.action=na.omit' in
  global model (spotted by Laura Busia on R-help).

Changes in version 1.9.13 (2013-10-28)
- (fixed) handling response variables with more than two levels in
  'nnet::multinom' models (reported by Ludo Duvaux on Stackoverflow)

Changes in version 1.9.12 (2013-10-21)
- further adjustments to deal with unavailability of 'lme4' on CRAN

Changes in version 1.9.11 (2013-09-30)
- Documentation: examples that depend on suggested packages have been made
  conditional on availability of the package
- getCall method for 'model.selection' can retrieve a component model call if
  index is given as a second argument.

Changes in version 1.9.10 (2013-08-27)
- pdredge: removed global assignments (within cluster nodes).

Changes in version 1.9.9 (2013-05-21)
- (fixed) beta.weights: bug with dimensions dropped (spotted by Dennis Duro,
  thanks to Ben Bolker for tracking it down)

Changes in version 1.9.8 (2013-05-02)
- (fixed) handling bar in formulas for 'hurdle' class of models (reported by
  Jean-Yves Barnagaud)

Changes in version 1.9.7 (2013-04-19)
- dredge: 'subset' expression now recognizes ".(x)" notation to indicate a
  variable rather than a model term. Error message from within a 'rank' function
  gives now a more meaningfull call (apparently it is a common mistake to have
  some misspelled arguments that get passed to 'rank' function through '...').

Changes in version 1.9.6 (2013-04-12)
- model.sel: better model naming in the result table
- (fixed) logLik.coxme: 'nobs' attribute now uses a correct number of
  observations (model$n[2]). "penalized" log-lik. is the default type now (Note
  that "logLik.coxme"'s argument "type" is undocumented).

Changes in version 1.9.5 (2013-04-04)
- (fixed) AICc: now takes number of observations from "nall" (if it is
  available) attribute of the 'logLik' object. If not present, "nobs" attribute
  is used.
- r.squaredGLMM: current implementation does not calculate the marginal variant
  correctly for Poisson family models, so until it is resolved 'NA' is returned,
  with a warning.

Changes in version 1.9.4 (2013-04-01)
- (fixed) pdredge: bug with wrong number of updated rows.
- Replaced all calls to the soon-to-be deprecated ".find.package" with
  "find.package".

Changes in version 1.9.3 (2013-02-21)
- (fixed) method registration for 'getAllTerms.gam' was missing (reported by
  Steven Delean).

Changes in version 1.9.2 (2013-02-01)
- updateable: new function to create a wrapper for functions returning
  non-updateable objects (adds a 'call' element to the function's result).
- (renamed) removed 'gamm' wrapper, which is now replaced by 'uGamm'.
- (added) 'predict' method replacement for 'gls' models (adds 'se.fit'
  argument).
- model.avg: no longer returns residuals (this is because residuals for models
  other than 'lm' can be calculated in several different ways - with different
  results).

Changes in version 1.9.1 (2013-01-24)
- (fixed) bugs with 'MCMCglmm' models and 'varying' lists in 'dredge'.

Changes in version 1.9.0 (2013-01-23)
- This version brings in more elaborated subsetting of models in 'dredge' and
  'model.selection' object, and a new variant of pseudo-R^2.
- [p]dredge: 'subset' can use 'varying' variables (as "V(varying.variable)") and
  number of model terms (as `*nvar*`). This allows for better fine-tuning of
  the selection table.
  'fixed' argument can be set to TRUE to fix all terms of 'global.model'.
[p]dredge, subset.model.selection: 'subset' expressions can now make use of a
  new function 'dc' ("dependency chain") to make inclusion of variables
  conditional on other variables.
- r.squaredGLMM: new function to calculate R^2 statistic for mixed effect
  models, described by Nakagawa & Schiezlich (2012).
- (added) support for 'splm' (from package 'splm'), and 'logistf' models (from
  package 'logistf').
- Cp: now accepts more than one model (like 'AIC').
- New demos "dredge.varying", "dredge.subset" and "gees".

Changes in version 1.8.2 (2012-12-07)
- (added) support for models of class 'mark' (from package 'RMark'). 'dredge'
  can currently only manipulate 'formula' element of argument
  'model.parameters'.
- simplify.formula, expand.formula: new functions to convert formula between
  expanded and shorthand notation (i.e. between 'a+b+a:b' and 'a*b').
- model.names: has new argument "use.letters".

Changes in version 1.8.1 (2012-11-23)
- (added) methods for class 'merMod' to accommodate recent changes in
  lme4_0.99999911-0.
- getAllTerms: now recognizes random effects in 'MCMCglmm'.

Changes in version 1.8.0 (2012-11-21)
- This version introduces support for GEE models ('gee','geeglm' and 'yags')
  ranked by QIC (note that 'yags' seems to be still quite buggy). Also 'clmm'
  and 'clm' from package 'ordinal' are now handled properly.
- QIC, quasiLik: new functions for use with GEE models.
- [p]dredge: argument 'subset' can be now a logical matrix representing allowed
  parameter combinations. Some improvements for speed have been made.
- [p]dredge, model.avg: new argument 'ct.args' for passing extra arguments to
  'coefTable'.

Changes in version 1.7.12 (2012-11-11)
- tests/classes.R: fixed compatibility spdep-0.5.53. (spdep::spautolm now uses
  method = "eigen", was "full")

Changes in version 1.7.11 (2012-07-13)
- coefTable.multinom: fixed an error when coefficients and standard errors were
  matrices.
- get.models: now checks for the object class of the passed arguments.

Changes in version 1.7.10 (2012-06-07)
- (fixed) dredge: bug with an error message when number of predictor exceeded
  maximum (thanks to Corina Logan for spotting this).
- manual: added 'glmmADMB' to the list of supported classes (reported by Rocio
  Jana).
- 'coxme' moved from 'Suggested' to 'Enhances' (to avoid build error when the
  dependency is missing).

Changes in version 1.7.9 (2012-04-03)
- (added) 'predict' methods for 'lme' and 'lmer' (both can calculate 'se.fit').
  'predict.lme' is a wrapper for its namesake from 'nlme' package (it is
  not exported, so it's visibility depends on the order the packages were
  loaded - but is always visible from MuMIn namespace).

Changes in version 1.7.8 (2012-04-01)
- (fixed) 'coef.model.selection' returns now proper coefficients

Changes in version 1.7.7 (2012-04-01)
- (fixed) dependencies in tests

Changes in version 1.7.6 (2012-04-01)
- dredge: with nested formula designs, 'marg.ex' is now found automatically
- predict.averaging: is now more flexible in how the predictions from
  generalized models are calculated (new attribute "backtransform").

Changes in version 1.7.5 (2012-03-27)
- (added) methods for 'MCMCglmm' class, and function 'DIC': works with
  'model.sel' and 'dredge' (but not 'model.avg').
'unmarked' is removed from 'Suggested' packages (recently it is often
  unavailable on CRAN and causes errors during R CHECK). Added workarounds to
  pass (or trick) the R CHECK.

Changes in version 1.7.3 (2012-02-01)
- (added) methods for 'glimML' class from package 'aod'

Changes in version 1.7.2 (2012-01-30)
- (fixed) 'nobs.coxme' returned the number of events was returned rather than
  the number of observations.
- (fixed) 'coefTable' gave an error for 'coxph' null model.
- (fixed) 'r.squaredLR' was evaluating the null model for 'lme' in a wrong
  environment.
- (fixed) 'getAllTerms' method for 'zeroinfl' was not registered.
- dredge: checks each generated model for the correct number of observations.


Changes in version 1.7.1 (2012-01-26)
- (added) methods for 'hurdle' and 'zeroinfl' classes (package 'pscf').
- coef, coefTable: new methods to extract coefficients from model selection
  tables.
- Documentation: list of supported models put into a separate page.

Changes in version 1.7.0 (2012-01-25)
- This version adds possibility to model average and re-rank (with another IC) a
  model selection table without recreating the fitted models. Models from
  package 'coxme' are now supported. Model selection tables include now extra
  columns showing differences in attributes of the modelling function call.
- model.avg: use 'model.selection' without refitting the models. Fixed a problem
  with averaging different types of models together (happened when 'df's were
  available only for some of component models).
- dredge: coefficient tables added to the result (attribute "coefTables"). The
  code has been simplified.
- print.model.selection: now reports random terms also for objects generated by
  'model.sel'.
- get.models: can handle 'model.selection' objects from 'model.sel'
- model.sel: re-ranking 'model.selection' without recreating original models
  (works only if the IC can be applied to logLik). Output has additional columns
  showing differences between models (based on call's arguments)
- (added) generic methods for 'coxme' and 'lmekin' classes (package 'coxme').

Changes in version 1.6.6 (2012-01-07)
- model.avg: fixed error occurring when non-estimable coefficients existed in
  the component models (problem reported by Annabel Smith)

Changes in version 1.6.5 (2011-11-28)
- pdredge example changed to use SOCK cluster type (portability issue).

Changes in version 1.6.4 (2011-11-26)
- coefTable: replaces 'tTable' (which still exists, but is deprecated), it
  accepts an argument 'dispersion'. The dispersion parameter can be also passed
  from 'model.avg'.
- pdredge: collects all the warnings and errors which occur during fitting, and
  stores them. They are printed below the table.
  The function does more thorough checking of the cluster nodes' environment,
  for possible missing variables and functions.
- get.models: "subset" argument can be now a character vector giving model
  names.
- (added) demos for model selection with models from 'unmarked' package using
  'dredge' and 'pdredge'.

Changes in version 1.6.3 (2011-11-15)
- pget.models: new function, parallel version of 'get.models'.
- (p)get.models: important change of the default behaviour: without the 'subset'
  argument, ALL models are returned. Also the '...' arguments were not used to
  update the returned models - this is corrected now.

Changes in version 1.6.2 (2011-11-13)
- pdredge: new function, a parallel version of dredge (experimental).

Changes in version 1.6.1 (2011-11-11)
- dredge: added generic support for all 'unmarked' models, and fixed some bugs
  with it.
- model.names: new function (previously was internal only)
- CAICF: adds to the collection of rarely used information criteria.

Changes in version 1.6.0 (2011-11-07)
- dredge: most important change (although invisible to the user) is in the way
  the model objects are updated. The new function 'makeArgs' is used to generate
  the updated call. This results in a very flexible interface to the modelling
  functions. The default method updates the 'formula' argument, other methods
  can be used to deal with more problematic calls (the models from package
  'unmarked' were a challenge). Apart from the model classes previously
  supported by 'dredge', support for 'unmarkedFitOccu', 'unmarkedFitColExt' and
  several other 'unmarkedFit' objects has been added.
- dredge: has new argument 'extra' to add additional statistics into the model
  selection table.
- r.squared: new function to calculate likelihood-ratio based pseudo-R-squared
- subset method for 'model.selection': accepts a shorthand notation "has(x)" to
  select rows where a variable is present.
- (added) support for 'survreg' and 'rq' models (packages 'survival' and
  'quantreg')

Changes in version 1.5.2 (2011-10-21)
- dredge: fixed a bug with wrong ordering of column names in the returned
  data.frame (thanks to Staffan Roos for reporting this).

Changes in version 1.5.1 (2011-10-20)
- compatibility with R prior to 2.13.0: added workarounds for missing generic
  function 'nobs'.

Changes in version 1.5.0 (2011-10-18)
- model.avg: removed the argument "method", the standard errors and confidence
  intervals are calculated only for coefficients averaged within a subset of
  models where they are present (method = "NA"). The "full" coefficients are
  also returned, but without std. errors.
- plot.model.selection: new function to visualize the model selection table
- manuals expanded, examples revised
- getAllTerms: should work for most of the classes derived from 'unmarkedFit'
- a load of small improvements, polishings and fixes, generally invisible to the
  user.

Changes in version 1.4.4 (2011-10-16)
- QAIC: no longer uses model deviance, as it gave biased values.
- ICOMP, Cp: new information criteria
- model.avg: now performs a smarter check for duplicate models, fixed
  calculation of importance values

- additional elements, so that several default methods work with it.

Changes in version 0.12.2 (2009-06-14)
- fixed: 'alpha' in "model.avg" was not passed to "par.avg"

Changes in version 0.12.1 (2009-04-20)
- fixed: method="NA" in model.avg, par.avg now accepts NA's in 'weight'

Changes in version 0.12.0 (2009-03-24)
- Change in version number only. Had to make this jump in numbering, as there
  was a typo in DESCRIPTION file of an early version, (0.11.2 instead of 0.1.0),
  and since then R-forge mechanism seemed to ignore actual newer versions, as
  they had lower number.

Changes in version 0.1.1 (2009-03-22)
- Modified: dredge: added "fixed" and "m.max" arguments.

Changes in version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
- Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root
  of variance). Thanks to Mick Wu.
- Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations,
  so now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

Changes in version 0.1.0
- dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
- Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, the name changed
  to MuMIn (from MUlti Model INference).
