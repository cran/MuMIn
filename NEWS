MuMIn package news:

Version: 1.13.4 (2015-02-24)
coefTable.coxph: added workaround for the case when variance-covariance matrix 
	is NA (as in results of 'intcox') (reported by Vanessa Boukili)

Version: 1.13.3 (2015-02-19)
get.models+subset.model.selection: unified 'subset' expression interpretation
dredge: no longer exceeds memory limit with very complex models, and its 
	efficiency has somewhat improved. With trace=2 a progress bar is displayed.
model.sel: has new attribute 'fit'.
"averaging" object now stores component models.
model.sel,subset,get.models: unified interpretation of the "subset" expression
(fixed) extracting random effects formula (affected 'r.squaredGLMM' for 'lmer', 
	reported by Yevgen Matusevych)
(fixed) makeArgs (and hence 'dredge'): formulas with no intercept are now 
	handled correctly in 'zeroinfl' models.

Version: 1.13.2 (2015-01-08)
(fixed) makeArgs (and hence 'dredge'): gave error if no random effects 
	was specified in 'glmmadmb' model (reported by Szymek Drobniak).

Version: 1.13.1 (2015-01-06)
(fixed) getAllTerms: now properly handles single formula in 'hurdle' and 
	'zeroinfl' models (package 'pscl').

Version: 1.13.0 (2015-01-03)
(added) get.response: utility to extract response variable.

Version: 1.12.4 (2014-12-26)
(added) stdizeFit: utility to modify model object or a call to modelling function 
	to use standardized data.

Version: 1.12.3 (2014-12-23)
(fixed) checkModels: workaround for the "dotted argument identity" issue (namely
	sometimes equal "..1"s are not identical).

Version: 1.12.2 (2014-12-19)
(fixed) [Q]AICc: previously they ignored REML argument for some model classes.
	The code has been rewritten so that most of the core calculation is done by
	a common internal function.

Version: 1.12.1 (2014-12-16)
minor corrections to the documentation

Version: 1.12.0 (2014-12-16)
(added) exprApply: new function to manipulate expressions (with example of use
	with 'dredge' to manipulate terms inside formula).
dredge, subset.model.selection: curly braces can be used to indicate complex 
	terms (e.g. {I(x)} or {s(x,k=2}) instead of backtick quotes. Spacing in 
	these expressions is irrelevant (as both whitespace and backticks seem to be 
	a problem for some users).

Version: 1.11.3 (2014-12-10)
(added) stdize: new function for standardizing data
(fixed) smarter sorting of interaction terms in coefficient names
print.model.selection: rank function call is added to the output

Version: 1.11.2 (2014-12-01)
(fixed) r.squaredGLMM: in "binomial" family models the residual variance is 
	used for additive dispersion (thanks to Paul Johnson). 
	There is still issue with 'lmer' with 'subset' argument, and 
	observation-level random term has to be specified manually.
(fixed) some formula-decomposition related functions (that sometimes caused 
	problems with 'r.squaredGLMM' for 'lmer', reported by Yevgen Matusevych)
dredge: warns about potentially misspecified arguments 
(added) predict method for 'gamm' class

Version: 1.11.1 (2014-11-19)
dredge: more efficient checking for marginality in model terms (~10x faster in 
	case of 4-way interaction). The argument 'marg.ex' is removed (exceptions 
	to marginality rule are inferred from the global model). 
getAllTerms: result has a new attribute 'deps' with a "term dependency matrix". 
nested: new function listing nested models (suggested by Giacomo Assandri).
updateable: added new argument 'eval.args'

Version: 1.10.8 (2014-11-14)
dredge, subset.model.selection: improved interpretation of 'subset' expressions. 
	"Term(x)" notation can be used instead of backtick quotes for complex term 
	names.

Version: 1.10.7 (2014-09-24)
(fixed) coef.multinom: gave a wrong order of coefficients for multiple level 
	responses (thanks to Alistair Senior who spotted this)

Version: 1.10.6 (2014-08-17)
(added) methods for 'maxlike' (from package with the same name)
lazy loading of datasets
plot.model.selection: improved and documented 

Version: 1.10.5 (2014-08-08)
get.models: can now use parallel computation if a valid 'cluster' is provided.
	It takes over the functionality of 'pget.models', which is now deprecated. 
	Also, the argument 'subset' must be now explicitely provided (so all models 
	are no longer fitted by default).

Version: 1.10.4 (2014-08-02)
(fixed) importance, model.avg: wrong order of 'N containing models' attribute
	(bug reported by Alba Estrada)
r.squaredGLMM: should be considerably faster and memory efficient due to 
	improved calculation of random effects variance (slow performance with large 
	datasets reported by Daniel Ezra Johnson).

Version: 1.10.3 (2014-06-27)
(fixed) dredge: no longer drops random term in 'glmmadmb' models (spotted by 
	Carlos Le√≥n)

Version: 1.10.2
mystery update
	
Version: 1.10.1 (2014-05-19)
dredge: more meaningful warning message about misspecified 'fixed' argument
pdredge: synchronized code with 'dredge'
documentation: improved formatting

Version: 1.10.0 (2014-05-02)
r.squaredGLMM: throws an error if contrasts that have been used for random 
	factors in the "merMod" model do not match the ones in model matrix. This 
	happens if there are factors in random slope formula and user has changed 
	relevant 'options(contrasts)' since the model was fitted.
dredge: 'na.action' checking now allows "option(na.action)" to be a function and 
	not only character string.

Version: 1.9.26 (2014-03-16)
(fixed) dredge: when columns/rows in a subset matrix were in different order 
	than model terms, the values became wrongly rearranged (spotted by 
	a certain Frank on Stackoverflow).

Version: 1.9.25 (2014-03-13)
(added) methods for 'cpglm' and 'cpglmm' (from package 'cplm') (suggested by 
Andrew Cooper)

Version: 1.9.24 (2014-02-26)
(fixed) 'getAllTerms.unmarkedFit' gave error when 'alpha' was estimated in 
	pcount model (when else?) (reported by Lindsey Garner)

Version: 1.9.23 (2014-02-24)
(added) methods 'model.matrix' and 'model.frame' for 'lme', because the default 
	ones give wrong results when there is 'subset' or 'contrasts' set, or 
	'na.omit'ting.

Version: 1.9.22 (2014-02-20)
r.squaredGLMM: can be now applied to models with random slopes (based on idea 
	and R code by Paul Johnson). Added calculation of conditional R^2 for 
	Poisson family models.

Version: 1.9.21 (2014-02-17)
logLik.asreml: number of estimated parameters ('df') is now calculated as the
	number of fixed effect coefficients + number of variance parameters
	(non-fixed and non-constained). This gives comparable numbers to similar
	lmer models. In 'Asreml-R manual', however, only the number of variance
	components is used as K for AIC calculation (page 15). The log-likelihood
	values of asreml are far different from those from lmer(REML = TRUE), even
	though coefficients are very close. Note also that REstricted-likelihood is
	returned, so model comparisions based on it are invalid.
r.squaredGLMM: checks if it is applied to a random intercepts model, otherwise
	error is given. This is a limitation of the original formula by Nakagawa &
	Schiezlich.

Version: 1.9.20 (2014-02-12)
(added) methods for 'phylolm' (suggestion by Rafael Maia)

Version: 1.9.19 (2013-12-21)
(added) 'merge.model.selection' combines two 'model.selection' tables. Note that
	this is different than 'merge' for 'data.frame's (requested by Rafael Maia)

Version: 1.9.18 (2013-12-18)
(added) methods for 'asreml' model (in commercial package 'asreml'). Note this 
	has not been tested extensively (thanks to Emeline Mourocq for an incentive 
	and testing)

Version: 1.9.17 (2013-12-14)
full-averaged coefficients and standard errors are now calculated by 'model.avg' 
	and relevant methods (argument full = TRUE) (suggested by Candan Soykan)
importance: result gives now also number of models containg each variable

Version: 1.9.16 (2013-11-24)
model.sel: now accepts arguments 'extra' and 'beta', like 'dredge' (requested by
	D. Duro on R-Forge).

Version: 1.9.15 (2013-11-17)
[p]dredge: improved checking for whether the global model removes missing data
	(na.action = "na.omit" or "na.exclude"). Note that code working with
	previous versions may give you an error now, setting options(na.action =
	"na.fail") prevents it.

Version: 1.9.14 (2013-11-03)
(added) support for 'betareg' (from package 'betareg') (suggested by Marie-Line
	Gentes)
(added) support for 'aodml' and 'aodql' (from package 'aods3') (suggested by 
	Renaud Lancelot)
[p]dredge: fixed a bug that occurred when there was 'na.action=na.omit' in
	global model (spotted by Laura Busia on R-help).

Version: 1.9.13 (2013-10-28)
(fixed) handling response variables with more than two levels in 
	'nnet::multinom' models (reported by Ludo Duvaux on Stackoverflow)

Version: 1.9.12 (2013-10-21)
further adjustments to deal with unavailability of 'lme4' on CRAN

Version: 1.9.11 (2013-09-30)
Documentation: examples that depend on suggested packages have been made 
	conditional on availability of the package
getCall method for 'model.selection' can retrieve a component model call if 
	index is given as a second argument.

Version: 1.9.10 (2013-08-27)
pdredge: removed global assignments (within cluster nodes).

Version: 1.9.9 (2013-05-21)
(fixed) beta.weights: bug with dimensions dropped (spotted by Dennis Duro, 
	thanks to Ben Bolker for tracking it down)

Version: 1.9.8 (2013-05-02)
(fixed) handling bar in formulas for 'hurdle' class of models (reported by 
	Jean-Yves Barnagaud)

Version: 1.9.7 (2013-04-19)
dredge: 'subset' expression now recognizes ".(x)" notation to indicate a 
	variable rather than a model term. Error message from within a 'rank' 
	function gives now a more meaningfull call (apparently it is a common 
	mistake to have some misspelled arguments that get passed to 'rank' function 
	through '...').

Version: 1.9.6 (2013-04-12)
model.sel: better model naming in the result table
(fixed) logLik.coxme: 'nobs' attribute now uses a correct number of observations 
	(model$n[2]). "penalized" log-lik. is the default type now (Note that 
	"logLik.coxme"'s argument "type" is undocumented).

Version: 1.9.5 (2013-04-04)
(fixed) AICc: now takes number of observations from "nall" (if it is available)
	attribute of the 'logLik' object. If not present, "nobs" attribute is used.
r.squaredGLMM: current implementation does not calculate the marginal variant
	correctly for Poisson family models, so until it is resolved 'NA' is
	returned, with a warning.
	
Version: 1.9.4 (2013-04-01)
(fixed) pdredge: bug with wrong number of updated rows.
Replaced all calls to the soon-to-be deprecated ".find.package" with
	"find.package".

Version: 1.9.3 (2013-02-21)
(fixed) method registration for 'getAllTerms.gam' was missing (reported by 
	Steven Delean).

Version: 1.9.2 (2013-02-01)
updateable: new function to create a wrapper for functions returning
	non-updateable objects (adds a 'call' element to the function's result).
(renamed) removed 'gamm' wrapper, which is now replaced by 'uGamm'.
(added) 'predict' method replacement for 'gls' models (adds 'se.fit' argument).
model.avg: no longer returns residuals (this is because residuals for models
	other than 'lm' can be calculated in several different ways - with different
	results).

Version: 1.9.1 (2013-01-24)
(fixed) bugs with 'MCMCglmm' models and 'varying' lists in 'dredge'.

Version: 1.9.0 (2013-01-23)
This version brings in more elaborated subsetting of models in 'dredge' and 
	'model.selection' object, and a new variant of pseudo-R^2. 
[p]dredge: 'subset' can use 'varying' variables (as "V(varying.variable)") and
	number of model terms (as `*nvar*`). This allows for better fine-tuning of
	the selection table.
	'fixed' argument can be set to TRUE to fix all terms of 'global.model'.
[p]dredge, subset.model.selection: 'subset' expressions can now make use of a 
	new function 'dc' ("dependency chain") to make inclusion of variables 
	conditional on other variables.
r.squaredGLMM: new function to calculate R^2 statistic for mixed effect models,
	described by Nakagawa & Schiezlich (2012).
(added) support for 'splm' (from package 'splm'), and 'logistf' models (from 
	package 'logistf').
Cp: now accepts more than one model (like 'AIC').
New demos "dredge.varying", "dredge.subset" and "gees".

Version: 1.8.2 (2012-12-07)
(added) support for models of class 'mark' (from package 'RMark'). 'dredge'
	can currently only manipulate 'formula' element of argument
	'model.parameters'.
simplify.formula, expand.formula: new functions to convert formula between 
	expanded and shorthand notation (i.e. between 'a+b+a:b' and 'a*b').
model.names: has new argument "use.letters".

Version: 1.8.1 (2012-11-23)
(added) methods for class 'merMod' to accommodate recent changes in 
	lme4_0.99999911-0.
getAllTerms: now recognizes random effects in 'MCMCglmm'.

Version: 1.8.0 (2012-11-21)
This version introduces support for GEE models ('gee','geeglm' and 'yags') 
	ranked by QIC (note that 'yags' seems to be still quite buggy).
	Also 'clmm' and 'clm' from package 'ordinal' are now handled properly.
QIC, quasiLik: new functions for use with GEE models.
[p]dredge: argument 'subset' can be now a logical matrix representing allowed 
	parameter combinations. Some improvements for speed have been made.
[p]dredge, model.avg: new argument 'ct.args' for passing extra arguments 
	to 'coefTable'.

Version: 1.7.12 (2012-11-11)
tests/classes.R: fixed compatibility spdep-0.5.53. (spdep::spautolm now uses 
	method = "eigen", was "full") 

Version: 1.7.11 (2012-07-13)
coefTable.multinom: fixed an error when coefficients and standard errors were 
	matrices.
get.models: now checks for the object class of the passed arguments.

Version: 1.7.10 (2012-06-07)
(fixed) dredge: bug with an error message when number of predictor exceeded 
	maximum (thanks to Corina Logan for spotting this).
manual: added 'glmmADMB' to the list of supported classes (reported by Rocio 
	Jana).
'coxme' moved from 'Suggested' to 'Enhances' (to avoid build error when the
	dependency is missing).

Version: 1.7.9 (2012-04-03)
(added) 'predict' methods for 'lme' and 'lmer' (both can calculate 'se.fit').
	'predict.lme' is a wrapper for its namesake from 'nlme' package (it is
	not exported, so it's visibility depends on the order the packages were 
	loaded - but is always visible from MuMIn namespace).

Version: 1.7.8 (2012-04-01)
(fixed) 'coef.model.selection' returns now proper coefficients

Version: 1.7.7 (2012-04-01)
(fixed) dependencies in tests

Version: 1.7.6 (2012-04-01)
dredge: with nested formula designs, 'marg.ex' is now found automatically
predict.averaging: is now more flexible in how the predictions from generalized
	models are calculated (new attribute "backtransform").

Version: 1.7.5 (2012-03-27)
(added) methods for 'MCMCglmm' class, and function 'DIC': works with 'model.sel'
	and 'dredge' (but not 'model.avg').
'unmarked' is removed from 'Suggested' packages (recently it is often 
	unavailable on CRAN and causes errors during R CHECK). Added workarounds to 
	pass (=cheat) the R CHECK.

Version: 1.7.3 (2012-02-01)
(added) methods for 'glimML' class from package 'aod'

Version: 1.7.2 (2012-01-30)
(fixed) 'nobs.coxme' returned the number of events was returned rather than 
	the number of observations.
(fixed) 'coefTable' gave an error for 'coxph' null model.
(fixed) 'r.squaredLR' was evaluating the null model for 'lme' in a wrong 
	environment.
(fixed) 'getAllTerms' method for 'zeroinfl' was not registered.
dredge: checks each generated model for the correct number of observations.


Version: 1.7.1 (2012-01-26)
(added) methods for 'hurdle' and 'zeroinfl' classes (package 'pscf').
coef, coefTable: new methods to extract coefficients from model selection 
	tables.
Documentation: list of supported models put into a separate page.

Version: 1.7.0 (2012-01-25)
This version adds possibility to model average and re-rank (with another IC) a 
	model selection table without recreating the fitted models. Models from 
	package 'coxme' are now supported. Model selection tables include now extra 
	columns showing differences in attributes of the modelling function call.
model.avg: use 'model.selection' without refitting the models. Fixed a problem 
	with averaging different types of models together (happened when 'df's were 
	available only for some of component models).
dredge: coefficient tables added to the result (attribute "coefTables"). The 
	code has been simplified.
print.model.selection: now reports random terms also for objects generated by
	'model.sel'.
get.models: can handle 'model.selection' objects from 'model.sel'
model.sel: re-ranking 'model.selection' without recreating original models 
	(works only if the IC can be applied to logLik). Output has additional 
	columns showing differences between models (based on call's arguments)
(added) generic methods for 'coxme' and 'lmekin' classes (package 'coxme').

Version: 1.6.6 (2012-01-07)
model.avg: fixed error occurring when non-estimable coefficients existed in the 
	component models (problem reported by Annabel Smith)

Version: 1.6.5 (2011-11-28)
pdredge example changed to use SOCK cluster type (portability issue).

Version: 1.6.4 (2011-11-26)
coefTable: replaces 'tTable' (which still exists, but is deprecated), it 
	accepts an argument 'dispersion'. The dispersion parameter can be also 
	passed from 'model.avg'.
pdredge: collects all the warnings and errors which occur during fitting, and 
	stores them. They are printed below the table.
	The function does more thorough checking of the cluster nodes' environment,
	for possible missing variables and functions.
get.models:  "subset" argument can be now a character vector giving model names.
(added) demos for model selection with models from 'unmarked' package using 
	'dredge' and 'pdredge'.

Version: 1.6.3 (2011-11-15)
pget.models: new function, parallel version of 'get.models'.
(p)get.models: important change of the default behaviour: without the 'subset' 
	argument, ALL models are returned. Also the '...' arguments were not used to
	update the returned models - this is corrected now.

Version: 1.6.2 (2011-11-13)
pdredge: new function, a parallel version of dredge (experimental).

Version: 1.6.1 (2011-11-11)
dredge: added generic support for all 'unmarked' models, and fixed some bugs 
	with it.
model.names: new function (previously was internal only)
CAICF: adds to the collection of rarely used information criteria.

Version: 1.6.0 (2011-11-07)
dredge: most important change (although invisible to the user) is in the way the
	model objects are updated. The new function 'makeArgs' is used to generate 
	the updated call. This results in a very flexible interface to the modelling
	functions. The default method updates the 'formula' argument, other methods 
	can be used to deal with more problematic calls (the models from package 
	'unmarked' were a challenge). Apart from the model classes previously
	supported by 'dredge', support for 'unmarkedFitOccu', 'unmarkedFitColExt'
	and several other 'unmarkedFit' objects has been added.
dredge: has new argument 'extra' to add additional statistics into the model 
	selection table.
r.squared: new function to calculate likelihood-ratio based pseudo-R-squared
subset method for 'model.selection': accepts a shorthand notation "has(x)" to 
	select rows where a variable is present.
(added) support for 'survreg' and 'rq' models (packages 'survival' and 
	'quantreg')

Version: 1.5.2 (2011-10-21)
dredge: fixed a bug with wrong ordering of column names in the returned 
	data.frame (thanks to Staffan Roos for reporting this).

Version: 1.5.1 (2011-10-20)
compatibility with R prior to 2.13.0: added workarounds for missing generic 
	function 'nobs'.

Version: 1.5.0 (2011-10-18)
model.avg: removed the argument "method", the standard errors and confidence 
	intervals are calculated only for coefficients averaged within a subset of 
	models where they are present (method = "NA"). The "full" coefficients are
	also returned, but without std. errors.
plot.model.selection: new function to visualize the model selection table
manuals expanded, examples revised
getAllTerms: should work for most of the classes derived from 'unmarkedFit'
a load of small improvements, polishings and fixes, generally invisible to the 
	user.

Version: 1.4.4 (2011-10-16)
QAIC: no longer uses model deviance, as it gave biased values.
ICOMP, Cp: new information criteria 
model.avg: now performs a smarter check for duplicate models, fixed calculation 
	of importance values
model.sel: new alias to 'mod.sel' (eventually will replace 'mod.sel').

Version: 1.4.3 (2011-10-13)
Beetle: new data - beetle mortality, with examples from B&A's book
dredge: new arguments 'varying', 'm.min' and 'evaluate'
manuals modified and corrected 
tests/gamm.R: tests for 'gamm'/'gamm4' support.

Version: 1.4.2 (2011-10-11)
support for 'gamm' and 'gamm4'
gamm: added a wrapper for gamm, that allows for updating the object (hopefully 
	needed only temporarily)

Version: 1.4.1 (2011-10-10)
A few changes to vignette 'gamm'

Version: 1.4.0 (2011-10-05)
importance: new function
mod.sel: added method for a 'model.selection' object

Version: 1.3.10 (2011-09-23)
Reverted changes made in previous version (package dependencies) to succesfully
	pass checks.

Version: 1.3.9 (2011-09-17)
removed  *.lmer *.glmer methods, added dependency on lme4 >= 0.999375-16
tTable.mer: minor change

Version: 1.3.8 (2011-09-17)
Restored compatibility with R 2.12.2
getAllTerms: new attribute 'intercept'

handling double intercept (phi(Int) and p(Int)) in 'unmarked'

Version: 1.3.6 (2011-09-12)
changes in the documentation and vignette

Version: 1.3.5 (2011-08-05)
mod.sel: new function
added methods for 'unmarkedFit' objects (package 'unmarked'), to provide 
	(limited) support in 'model.avg'

Version: 1.3.4 (2011-08-03)
Added vignette document on model selection with 'gamm' and 'gamm4'
(thanks to Graham MacDonald for an incentive)

model.avg: now may be used directly with 'model.selection' object
summary.averaging: gives now more information

Version: 1.2.4 (2011-07-29)
fixed handling of spatial parameters (lambda, rho) in models from package 
	'spdep'
dredge: modified for better performance
dredge, get.models: can deal with glms with starting values provided ('start'
	argument)
QAIC: added a note in documentation stating that is uses deviance rather than
	logLik in the calculation

Version: 1.2.3 (2011-04-07)
fixed some REML/ML issues, AICc rewritten (based on the new AIC code in stats)

Version: 1.2.2 (2011-04-06)
nobs: corrected methods for mixed models, added documentation page

Version: 1.2.1 (2011-04-05)
.GetLogLik - hidden helper function (returns the proper logLik to use)

Version: 1.2.0 (2011-04-04)
AICc has new argument REML used with mixed models. Thanks to Benjamin Augustine
	for suggestion.

Version: 1.1.2 (2011-03-19)
removed arguments 'alpha' and 'level' from model.avg. 'confint' is used instead
	to obtain CI

Version: 1.1.1 (2011-03-18)
the printed output of 'averaging' has been made consistent with that of lm and
	glm: 'print' gives concise information and 'summary' gives more details.
confint.averaging: new function.
print.summary.averaging: new function.

Version: 1.1.0 (2011-03-10)
added z-statistic, p-values (with significance stars) to model.avg output

Version: 1.0.0 (2011-02-10)
get.models: fixed - arguments in ... were not passed to updated models
predict.averaging: predictions on response scale can be calculated
	(type=response)

getAllTerms: improved handling of interactions, random terms (lmer) and
	"offset()"
formulaAllowed: now allows for exceptions in margins presence checking (new
argument: "except")
dredge: now tries to call fitting function directly rather than through update
	(more effective in case when model not passed as a variable). New arguments:
	"trace", and "marg.ex" - marginality checking exceptions.

Version: 0.13.10 (2010-08-26)
getAllTerms: fixed a bug with with wrong ordering of interaction terms (resulted
	with a:b or b:a depending on the set of terms). Improved handling of random
	terms in lme.

ordering of interaction components in coefficient names.

Version: 0.13.4 (2010-07-21)
'beta.weights' now uses 'tTable' (support for more model types), 'dredge' with
beta=TRUE tries out if it can get beta.weights working.
Manual: added gls and rlm to the list of supported models

Fixed compatibility issues with models of class "lme" and "sarlm".
"model.avg" does now some checking whether all models were fitted to the same
data and have the same response.

Version: 0.12.13 (2010-07-09)
'recalc.weights' argument added to "subset.model.selection".
Small bug fixed in dredge.

Version: 0.12.12 (2010-07-08)
New in "dredge": Subsetting models a priori according to a formula

Subset/extract methods for 'model.selection' object

Version: 0.12.10 (2010-07-05)
Fixed "predict.averaging" for missing 'newdata' handling; Table returned by

Tidying up the code, small changes.

Version: 0.12.4 (2010-06-21)
added: "predict.averaging" and "coef.averaging", 'averaging' object contains
additional elements, so that several default methods work with it.

Version: 0.12.2 (2009-06-14)
fixed: 'alpha' in "model.avg" was not passed to "par.avg"

Version: 0.12.1 (2009-04-20)
fixed: method="NA" in model.avg, par.avg now accepts NA's in 'weight'

Version: 0.12.0 (2009-03-24)
Change in version number only. Had to make this jump in numbering, as there was
a typo in DESCRIPTION file of an early version, (0.11.2 instead of 0.1.0), and
since then R-forge mechanism seemed to ignore actual newer versions, as they had
lower number.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-22)
Modified: dredge: added "fixed" and "m.max" arguments.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root
of variance). Thanks to Mick Wu.
Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations, so
now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

Version 0.1.0
dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, its name changed
to MuMIn (from MUlti Model INference).
