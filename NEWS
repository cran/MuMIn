MuMIn package news:

Version: 1.6.1 (2011-11-11)
dredge: added generic support for all 'unmarked' models, and fixed some bugs 
	with it.
model.names: new function (previously was internal only)
CAICF: adds to the collection of rarely used information criteria

Version: 1.6.0 (2011-11-07)
dredge: most important change (although invisible to the user) is in the way the
	model objects are updated. The new function 'makeArgs' is used to generate 
	the updated call. This results in a very flexible interface to the modelling
	functions. The default method updates the 'formula' argument, other methods 
	can be used to deal with more problematic calls (the models from package 
	'unmarked' were a challenge). Apart from the model classes previously
	supported by 'dredge', support for 'unmarkedFitOccu', 'unmarkedFitColExt'
	and several other 'unmarkedFit' objects has been added.
dredge: has new argument 'extra' to add additional statistics into the model 
	selection table.
r.squared: new function t ocalculate likelihood-ratio based pseudo-R-squared
subset method for 'model.selection' accepts a shorthand notation "has(x)" to 
	select rows where a variable is present.
support for 'survreg' and 'rq' models (packages 'survival' and 'quantreg')

Version: 1.5.2 (2011-10-21)
dredge: fixed as bug with wrong ordering of column names in the returned 
	data.frame (thanks to Staffan Roos for reporting this).

Version: 1.5.1 (2011-10-20)
compatibility with R prior to 2.13.0: added workarounds for missing generic 
	function 'nobs'.

Version: 1.5.0 (2011-10-18)
model.avg: removed the argument "method", the standard errors and confidence 
	intervals are calculated only for coefficients averaged within a subset of 
	models where they are present (method = "NA"). The "full" coefficients are
	also returned, but without std. errors.
plot.model.selection: new function to visualize the model selection table
manuals expanded, examples revised
getAllTerms: should work for most of the classes derived from 'unmarkedFit'
a load of small improvements, polishings and fixes, generally invisible to the 
	user.

Version: 1.4.4 (2011-10-16)
QAIC: no longer uses model deviance, as it gave biased values.
ICOMP, Cp: new information criteria 
model.avg: now performs a smarter check for duplicate models, fixed calculation 
	of importance values
model.sel: new alias to 'mod.sel' (eventually will replace 'mod.sel').

Version: 1.4.3 (2011-10-13)
Beetle: new data - beetle mortality, with examples from B&A's book
dredge: new arguments 'varying', 'm.min' and 'evaluate'

Tidying up the code, small changes.

Version: 0.12.4 (2010-06-21)
added: "predict.averaging" and "coef.averaging", 'averaging' object contains
additional elements, so that several default methods work with it.

Version: 0.12.2 (2009-06-14)
fixed: 'alpha' in "model.avg" was not passed to "par.avg"

Version: 0.12.1 (2009-04-20)
fixed: method="NA" in model.avg, par.avg now accepts NA's in 'weight'

Version: 0.12.0 (2009-03-24)
Change in version number only. Had to make this jump in numbering, as there was
a typo in DESCRIPTION file of an early version, (0.11.2 instead of 0.1.0), and
since then R-forge mechanism seemed to ignore actual newer versions, as they had
lower number.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-22)
Modified: dredge: added "fixed" and "m.max" arguments.

Version 0.1.1 (2009-03-17)
Fixed: par.avg: Variance estimate corrected (previous estimate was square root
of variance). Thanks to Mick Wu.
Fixed: dredge: Apparently "expand.grid" cannot handle too many combinations, so
now dredge stops with a more explanatory message

Version 0.1.0
dRedging (0.11.2) moved to R-Forge.
Since model averaging is now the main focus of the package, its name changed
to MuMIn - MUltiModelINference.
