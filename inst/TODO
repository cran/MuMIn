TODO list for MuMIn package:

*  model.names: add textual representation of a model
*  model.avg: checking for consistency in contrasts used over the model set
** parallel evaluation for 'dredge' and 'get.models'
** handling random effects in 'dredge' in lme and lmer. Currently 'varying' may
       be used with lme for that purpose
