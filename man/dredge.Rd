\description{
Generate a set of models with combinations (subsets) of the terms in the global
model, with optional rules for inclusion.
}

\usage{
dredge(global.model, beta = FALSE, evaluate = TRUE,
    rank = "AICc", fixed = NULL, m.max = NA, m.min = 0, subset,
    marg.ex = NULL, trace = FALSE, varying, extra, ...)


\method{print}{model.selection}(x, abbrev.names = TRUE, warnings = getOption("warn") != -1L,
    ...)

}

\arguments{
	\item{global.model}{a fitted \sQuote{global} model object. See
	\sQuote{Details} for a list of supported types. }

	\item{beta}{logical, should standardized coefficients be returned? }

	\item{evaluate}{whether to evaluate and rank the models. If \code{FALSE}, a
	list of model \code{call}s is returned. }

	\item{rank}{optional custom rank function (information criterion) to be used
	instead \code{AICc}, e.g. \code{AIC}, \code{QAIC} or \code{BIC}.
	See \sQuote{Details}. }

	\item{fixed}{optional, either a single sided formula or a character vector
	giving names of terms to be included in all models. }

	\item{m.max, m.min}{optionally the maximum and minimum number of terms in a
	single model (excluding the intercept), \code{m.max} defaults to the number
	of terms in \code{global.model}. }

	\item{subset}{ logical expression describing models to keep in the resulting
		set. See \sQuote{Details}. }

	\item{marg.ex}{a character vector specifying names of variables for which
	NOT to check for marginality restrictions when generating model formulas. If
	this argument is set to \code{TRUE}, all combinations of terms are used
	(i.e. no checking). If \code{NA} or missing, the exceptions will be found
	based on the terms of \code{global.model}. See \sQuote{Details}.  }

	\item{trace}{if \code{TRUE}, all calls to the fitting function (i.e. updated
	\code{global.model} calls) are printed before actual fitting takes place. }

	\item{varying}{ optionally, a named list describing the additional arguments
	to vary between the generated models. Names are the names of the arguments,
	and each item provides a list of choices. Complex items in the choice list
	(such as \code{family} objects) should be either named (uniquely) or quoted
	(unevaluated, e.g. using \code{\link{alist}}, see \code{\link{quote}}),
	otherwise it may produce rather unpleasant effects. See example in
	\code{\link{Beetle}}. }

	\item{extra}{ optional additional statistics to include in the result,
	provided as functions, function names or a list of such (best if named
	or quoted). Similarly as in \code{rank} argument, each function must accept
	fitted object model as an argument and return (an object coercible to) a
	numeric vector.
	These can be e.g. additional information criterions or goodness-of-fit
	statistics. The character strings "R^2" and "adjR^2" are treated in a
	special way, and will add a likelihood-ratio based \eqn{R^{^2}}{R^2} and
	modified-\eqn{R^{^2}}{R^2} respectively to the result (this is more
	efficient than using \code{\link{r.squaredLR}} directly).
	}

  \item{x}{
    a \code{model.selection} object, returned by \code{dredge}. }

  \item{abbrev.names}{ should variable names be abbreviated when printing?
	(useful with many variables). }

  \item{warnings}{ if \code{TRUE}, errors and warnings issued during the model
	fitting are printed below the table (currently, only with \code{pdredge}).
	To permanently remove the warnings, set the object's attribute "warnings" to
	\code{NULL}. }

  \item{\dots}{ optional arguments for the \code{rank} function. Any can be
    an expression (of mode \code{call}), in which case any \code{x} within it
    will be substituted with a current model. }
}


\details{

For a list of model types that can be used as a \code{global.model} see
\link[=MuMIn-models]{list of supported models}. \code{gamm} and \code{gamm4}
should be evaluated \emph{via} the wrapper \code{MuMIn::\link[MuMIn]{gamm}}.

Models are fitted one by one through repeated evaluation of modified calls to
the \code{global.model} (in a similar fashion as with \code{update}). This
method, while robust in that it can be applied to a variety of different model
object types is not very efficient, and may be time-intensive.

Note that the number of combinations grows exponentially with number of
predictor variables (\ifelse{latex}{\eqn{2^{N}}}{2^N}). As there can be
potentially a large number of models to evaluate, to avoid memory overflow the
fitted model objects are not stored in the result. To get (a subset of) the
models, use \code{\link{get.models}} on the object returned by \code{dredge}.

Handling interactions, \code{dredge} respects marginality constraints, so
\dQuote{all possible combinations} do not include models containing interactions
without their respective main effects. This behaviour can be altered by
\code{marg.ex} argument, which can be used to allow for simple nested designs.
For example, with global model of form \code{a / (x + z)}, one would use
\code{marg.ex = "a"} and \code{fixed = "a"}. If \code{global.model} has such a
formula, and \code{marg.ex} is missing or \code{NA}, it will be adjusted
automatically.

\code{rank} is found by a call to \code{match.fun} and may be specified as a
function or a symbol (e.g. a back-quoted name) or a character string specifying
a function to be searched for from the environment of the call to \code{dredge}.
Function \code{rank} must be able to accept model as a first argument and must
always return a scalar. Typical choice for \code{rank} would be "AIC", "QAIC" or
"BIC" (\pkg{stats} or \pkg{nlme}).

The argument \code{subset} acts in a similar fashion to that in the function
\code{subset} for \code{data.frames}: the model terms can be referred to by name
as variables in the expression, with the difference that they are always logical
(i.e. \code{TRUE} if a term exists in the model). The expression can contain
any of the \code{global.model} terms (use \code{getAllTerms(global.model)} to
list them). It can have a form of an unevaluated \code{call}, \code{expression}
object, or a one sided \code{formula}. See \sQuote{Examples}.
Compound model terms (such as \sQuote{as-is} expressions within \code{I()} or
 smooths in \code{gam}) should be treated as non-syntactic names and
enclosed in back-ticks (see \link[base]{Quotes}). Mind the spacing, names
must match exactly the term names in model's formula. To simply keep certain
terms in all models, use of argument \code{fixed} is more efficient.

Use of \code{na.action = na.omit} (\R's default) in \code{global.model} should
be avoided, as it results with sub-models fitted to different data sets, if
there are missing values. In versions >= 0.13.17 a warning is given in such a
case.

There are \code{\link[=subset.model.selection]{subset}} and \code{plot} methods,
the latter produces a graphical representation of model weights and variable
relative importance.
Coefficients can be extracted with \code{coef} or \code{\link{coefTable}}.

\value{
\code{dredge} returns an object of class \code{model.selection}, being a
\code{data.frame} with models' coefficients (or presence/\code{NA} for factors),
	\emph{df} - number of parameters, log-likelihood, the information criterion
	value, delta-IC and \emph{Akaike weight}. Models are ordered by the value of
	the information criterion specified by \code{rank} (lowest on top).

The attribute \code{"calls"} is a list containing the model calls used (arranged
in the same order as the models).
Other attributes:
\code{"global"} - the \code{global.model} object,
\code{"rank"} - the \code{rank} function used, \code{"call"} - the matched
call, and
\code{"warnings"} - list of errors and warnings given by the modelling function
	during the fitting, with model number appended to each. The associated model
	call can be found with \code{attr(*, "calls")[["i"]]}, where \var{i} is the
	model number.

\note{
Users should keep in mind the hazards that a \dQuote{thoughtless approach}
of evaluating all possible models poses. Although this procedure is in certain
cases useful and justified, it may result in selecting a spurious \dQuote{best}
model, due to the model selection bias.

\emph{\dQuote{Let the computer find out} is a poor strategy and usually reflects
the fact that the researcher did not bother to think clearly about the problem
of interest and its scientific setting} (Burnham and Anderson, 2002).
