\title{Evaluate "all possible" models}
\description{
Runs models with all possible combinations of the explanatory variables in the
supplied model. }

\usage{
dredge(global.model, beta = FALSE, eval = TRUE, rank = "AICc",
    fixed = NULL, m.max = NA, subset, marg.ex = NULL, trace = FALSE, ...)

\method{print}{model.selection}(x, abbrev.names = TRUE, ...)

}

\arguments{
  \item{global.model}{a fitted \sQuote{global} model object. Currently, it can
	be a \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{rlm}, \code{gam}, \code{gls}, \code{lme},
	\code{lmer}, \code{sarlm} or \code{spautolm}, but also other types are
	likely to work (untested).
	}

  \item{beta}{logical should standardized coefficients be returned rather than
  normal ones?}

  \item{eval}{whether to evaluate and rank the models. If FALSE, a list of all
  possible model formulas is returned}

  \item{rank}{optional custom rank function (information criterion) to be used
  instead AICc, e.g. \code{QAIC} or \code{BIC}, See \sQuote{Details}}

  \item{fixed}{optional, either a single sided formula or a character vector
  giving names of terms to be included in all models}

  \item{m.max}{optional, maximum number of terms to be included in single model,
  defaults to the number of terms in \code{global.model}}

  \item{subset}{
	logical expression to put additional constraints for the set of models. Can
	contain any of the \code{global.model} terms. Run
	\code{getAllTerms(global.model)} to list all the terms. Complex expressions
	(e.g smooth functions in \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} models) should be treated
	as non-syntactic names and enclosed in backticks (see \link[base]{Quotes}).
	Mind the spacing, names must match exactly the term names in model's
	formula.
	To simply keep variables in all models, use of \code{fixed} is preferred.
  }

  \item{marg.ex}{
	a character vector specyfying names of variables for which NOT to check for
	marginality restrictions when generating model formulas. If this argument is
	set to TRUE, all model formulas are used (i.e. no checking). See
	\sQuote{Details}.
  }

  \item{trace}{
	if TRUE, all calls to the fitting function (i.e. updated \code{global.model}
	calls) are printed.
  }


  \item{x}{
	a \code{model.selection} object, returned by \code{dredge}.
	}

  \item{abbrev.names}{
	Should variable names be abbreviated when printing? (useful with many
		variables)
  }

  \item{\dots}{optional arguments for the \code{rank} function. Any can be
	an expression (of mode \code{call}), in which case any \code{x} within it
	will be substituted with a current model. }
}


\details{

Models are run one by one by calling \code{\link{update}} with modified
\code{formula} argument. This method, while robust in that it can be applied to
a variety of different models, is not very efficient, so may be time (and
memory) consuming.

Handling interactions, \code{dredge} respects marginality constraints, so
\dQuote{all possible combinations} do not include models containing interactions
without their respective main effects.
This behaviour can be altered by \code{marg.ex} argument. It can be used to
allow for simple nested designs. For example, with global model of form \code{a
/ (x + z)}, use \code{marg.ex = "a"} and \code{fixed = "a"}.

\code{rank} is found by a call to \code{match.fun} and typically is specified as
a function or a symbol (e.g. a backquoted name) or a character string specifying
a function to be searched for from the environment of the call to lapply.

Function \code{rank} must be able to accept model as a first argument and must
always return a scalar.
}


\value{
\code{dredge} returns an object of class \code{model.selection}, being a
\code{\link{data.frame}} with models' coefficients, k, deviance/RSS, R-squared,
AIC, AICc, delta and weight. This depends on a type of model. Models are ordered
according to \code{\link{AICc}} (lowest on top), or by \code{rank} function if
specified. The attribute "formulas" is a list containing model formulas.

\note{

Make sure there is no a \code{na.action} set to \code{na.omit} in
\code{global.model}. This can result with models fitted to different data sets,
if there are NA's present.

\code{\link{get.models}}, \code{\link{model.avg}}.
\code{\link{QAIC}} has examples of using custom rank function.

There is also \code{\link{subset.model.selection}} method.

\examples{
# Example from Burnham and Anderson (2002), page 100:
data(Cement)
lm1 <- lm(y ~ ., data = Cement)
dd <- dredge(lm1)
subset(dd, delta < 4)

#models with delta.aicc < 4
model.avg(get.models(dd, subset = delta < 4)) # get averaged coefficients

#or as a 95\% confidence set:
top.models <- get.models(dd, cumsum(weight) <= .95)

model.avg(top.models) # get averaged coefficients

#topmost model:
top.models[[1]]

\dontrun{
# Examples of using 'subset':
# exclude models containing both X1 and X2
dredge(lm1, subset = !X1 | !X2)
# keep only models containing X3
dredge(lm1, subset = X3)
# the same, but more effective:
dredge(lm1, fixed = "X3")
