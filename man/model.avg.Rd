\title{Model averaging}
\description{
Model averaging based on an information criterion.
}

\usage{
model.avg(object, ..., beta = FALSE, method = c("0", "NA"),
    rank = NULL, rank.args = NULL, revised.var = TRUE)
}

\arguments{
    \item{object}{A fitted model object or a list of such objects. Alternatively
        an object of class \code{model.selection}. See \sQuote{Details}.}

    \item{\dots}{ more fitted model objects }

    \item{beta}{Logical, should standardized coefficients be returned?}

    \item{method}{The method of averaging parameter estimators that are not
        common for all the models. Either \code{"0"} (default) or \code{"NA"}.
        See \sQuote{Details}.}

    \item{rank}{Optional, custom rank function (information criterion) to use
        instead of \code{AICc}, e.g. \code{QAIC} or \code{BIC}, may be omitted
        if \code{object} is a model list returned by \code{get.models}
        or a \code{model.selection} object.
        See \sQuote{Details}.}

    \item{rank.args}{Optional \code{list} of arguments for the \code{rank}
        function. If one is an expression, an \code{x} within it is substituted
        with a current model.}

    \item{revised.var}{Logical, indicating whether to use revised formula for
        standard errors. See \code{\link{par.avg}}.}
}

\value{

An object of class \code{averaging} with following elements:

 \item{summary}{a \code{data.frame} with deviance, AICc, Delta and weights
    for the component models.}
 \item{coefficients, variance}{matrices of component models' coefficients and
    their variances}
 \item{variable.codes}{names of the variables with numerical codes used in the
    summary}
 \item{avg.model}{the averaged model summary, (\code{data.frame} containing
    averaged coefficients, unconditional standard error, adjusted SE,
    and confidence intervals)}
 \item{importance}{the relative importance of the predictor variables:
    calculated as a sum of the Akaike weights over all of the models in
    which the parameter of interest appears.
 }
 \item{beta}{(logical) were standardized coefficients used?}
 \item{term.names}{character vector giving names of all terms in the model}
 \item{residuals}{the residuals (response minus fitted values).}
 \item{x, formula}{the model matrix and formula analogical to those that would
    be used in a single model.}
 \item{method}{how the missing terms were handled ("NA" or "0").}
 \item{call}{the matched call.}

}

\details{

\code{model.avg} has been tested to work with the following model classes:
\itemize{
    \item \code{lm}, \code{glm}
    \item \code{gam} (\pkg{mgcv})
    \item \code{lme}, \code{gls} (\pkg{nlme})
    \item \code{lmer} (\pkg{lme4})
    \item \code{rlm}, \code{glm.nb} \code{polr} (\pkg{MASS})
    \item \code{multinom} (\pkg{nnet})
    \item \code{sarlm}, \code{spautolm} (\pkg{spdep})
    \item \code{glmmML} (\pkg{glmmML})
    \item \code{coxph} (\pkg{survival})
}

\code{model.avg} may be used with a list of models, or an object returned by
    \code{dredge}. In the latter case, the models from the model selection table
    are evaluated (with a call to \code{get.models}) prior to averaging.
    A warning is given if the subset argument is not provided, and the default
    \code{delta <= 4} will be used.

Other model types are also likely to be supported, in particular those
    inheriting from one of the above classes. See \sQuote{Details} section of
    the \sQuote{\link{Miscellaneous}} page to see how to provide support for
    other types of models.

With \code{method = "0"} (default) all predictors are averaged as if they were
    present in all models in the set, and the value of parameter estimate is
    taken to be 0 if it is not present in a particular model. If \code{method =
    "NA"}, the predictors are averaged only over the models in which they
    appear.

\code{rank} is found by a call to \code{\link[base]{match.fun}} and typically is
    specified as a function or a symbol (e.g. a back-quoted name) or a character
    string specifying a function to be searched for from the environment of the
    call to lapply. \code{rank} must be a function able to accept model as a
    first argument and must always return a scalar.

Some generic methods such as \code{\link{predict.averaging}}, \code{\link{coef}},
    \code{\link[stats]{formula}},
    \code{\link[stats]{residuals}} and \code{\link[stats]{vcov}} are supported. \cr
    \code{logLik} method returns a list of \code{\link[stats]{logLik}} objects
    for the component models.
}

\note{

From version 1.0.1, \code{print} method provides only a concise output
(similarly as for \code{lm}), to print a full summary of the results use
\code{summary} function. Confidence intervals can be obtained with
\code{\link{confint}}.

See \code{\link{par.avg}} for details of averaged model calculation.

\code{\link{dredge}}, \code{\link{get.models}}. \code{\link{QAIC}} has examples
of using custom rank function and prediction with confidence intervals. \cr
\code{\link{AICc}} has examples of averaging models fitted by REML.


\code{\link[AICcmodavg]{modavg}} in package \pkg{AICcmodavg}, and
\code{\link[glmulti]{coef.glmulti}} in package \pkg{glmulti} also perform model
averaging.

# Example from Burnham and Anderson (2002), page 100:
data(Cement)
lm1 <- lm(y ~ ., data = Cement)
dd <- dredge(lm1)
dd

#models with delta.aicc < 4
model.avg(get.models(dd, subset = delta < 4)) # get averaged coefficients

#or as a 95\% confidence set:
top.models <- get.models(dd, cumsum(weight) <= .95)

model.avg(top.models) # get averaged coefficients
\dontrun{
# The same result
model.avg(dd, cumsum(weight) <= .95)
}

\dontrun{
# using BIC (Schwarz's Bayesian criterion) to rank the models
BIC <- function(x) AIC(x, k=log(length(residuals(x))))
mav <- model.avg(top.models, rank=BIC)
